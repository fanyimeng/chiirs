	Abstract = {The central kpc of the Milky Way might be expected to differ significantly from the rest of the Galaxy with regard to gasdynamics and the formation of young stellar objects (YSOs). We probe this possibility with mid-infrared observations obtained with Infrared Array Camera and Multiband Imaging Photometer on Spitzer and with Midcourse Space Experiment. We use color-color diagrams and spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to explore the nature of YSO candidates (including objects with 4.5 μm excesses possibly due to molecular emission). There is an asymmetry in the distribution of the candidate YSOs, which tend to be found at negative Galactic longitudes; this behavior contrasts with that of the molecular gas, approximately 2/3 of which is at positive longitudes. The small-scale height of these objects suggests that they are within the Galactic center region and are dynamically young. They lie between two layers of infrared dark clouds and may have originated from these clouds. We identify new sites for this recent star formation by comparing the mid-IR, radio, submillimeter, and methanol maser data. The methanol masers appear to be associated with young, embedded YSOs characterized by 4.5 μm excesses. We use the SEDs of these sources to estimate their physical characteristics; their masses appear to range from ~10 to ~20 M <SUB>sun</SUB>. Within the central 400 × 50 pc (|l| &lt; 1fdg3 and |b| &lt; 10') the star formation rate (SFR) based on the identification of Stage I evolutionary phase of YSO candidates is about 0.14 M <SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Given that the majority of the sources in the population of YSOs are classified as Stage I objects, we suggest that a recent burst of star formation took place within the last 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. This suggestion is also consistent with estimates of SFRs within the last ~10<SUP>7</SUP> yr showing a peak around 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr ago. Lastly, we find that the Schmidt-Kennicutt Law applies well in the central 400 pc of the Galaxy. This implies that star formation does not appear to be dramatically affected by the extreme physical conditions in the Galactic center region.},

	Abstract = {We study the evolution of H II regions inside accreting hot molecular cores (HMCs). The H II regions are being pushed by a strong stellar wind from a massive young star at the center. We consider a range of pressures characteristic of HMCs. We find that thermal conductivity reduces to a thin shell the bubble of hot shocked stellar wind so that the expansion of the H II region is driven by the momentum of the stellar wind. The H II region can expand beyond the boundary of the HMC at ~0.1 pc, in t&lt;~5×10<SUP>4</SUP>yr. Just before reaching the HMC boundary, it has equatorial emission measures EM<SUB>eq</SUB>~3×10<SUP>7</SUP> cm<SUP>-6</SUP> pc, characteristic of ultracompact H II regions. In fact, these ionized regions will evolve from hypercompact to ultracompact H II regions as they expand inside the HMC. We also study the effect of the magnitude of the thermal conductivity coefficient on the evolution of the shocked stellar wind shell and calculate its hard X-ray emission. Because of the oscillating cooling instability of the shell, the X-ray emission is variable. This work addresses the birth and evolution of H II regions inside the HMCs where massive stars are born.},

@article{Garay:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We present multifrequency radio continuum observations, made with ATCA, of a sample of 15 southern hemisphere luminous IRAS point sources, all with colors typical of compact H II regions and associated with CS (2--&gt;1) emission. The sources were observed at 1.4, 2.5, 4.8, and 8.6 GHz with angular resolutions of about 7", 4", 2", and 1", respectively. Radio emission was detected toward 14 objects. Nine IRAS objects are associated with single regions of ionized gas with simple morphologies; three are associated with two regions of ionized gas, each of which also shows simple morphologies, and two are associated with regions of ionized gas that have complex structure. The H II regions with simple morphologies have linear diameters in the range 0.011-0.9 pc and electron densities in the range 10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and are excited by stars with luminosities in the range 9×10<SUP>3</SUP>-2×10<SUP>5</SUP> L<SUB>solar</SUB>. We find that the H II regions in our sample, most of which lie at the center of massive and dense molecular cores with H<SUB>2</SUB> densities of ~4×10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and line widths of ~3 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, are excited by stars with an output of UV photons of typically &lt;=3×10<SUP>48</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Under these conditions the regions of ionized gas reach pressure equilibrium with the dense molecular surroundings in only ~5×10<SUP>3</SUP> yr. We conclude that the main mechanism of confinement of the compact H II regions in our sample is provided by the high density and large turbulent pressure of the surrounding molecular gas; therefore, their age can be much longer than their dynamical timescale. If the objects in our sample are representative of the Galactic IRAS sources with colors of compact H II regions, then the problem with the large rate of massive star formation in the Galaxy might be solved.},

	Abstract = {We present observations of the H91α recombination line emission towards a sample of nine HII regions associated with 6.7-GHz methanol masers, and report arcsecond-scale emission around compact cores. We derive physical parameters for our sources, and find that although simple hydrostatic models of region evolution reproduce the observed region sizes, they significantly underestimate emission measures. We argue that these findings are consistent with young source ages in our sample, and can be explained by existence of density gradients in the ionized gas.},

	Abstract = {We report the results of a search for 12.2-GHz methanol maser emission, targeted towards 113 known 6.7-GHz methanol masers associated with 1.2-mm dust continuum emission. Observations were carried out with the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) Parkes 64-m radio telescope in the period 2008 June 20-25. We detect 68 12.2-GHz methanol masers with flux densities in excess of our 5σ detection limit of 0.55 Jy, 30 of which are new discoveries. This equates to a detection rate of 60 per cent, similar to previous searches of comparable sensitivity. We have made a statistical investigation of the properties of the 1.2-mm dust clumps with and without associated 6.7-GHz methanol maser and find that 6.7-GHz methanol masers are associated with 1.2-mm dust clumps with high-flux densities, masses and radii. We additionally find that 6.7-GHz methanol masers with higher peak luminosities are associated with less dense 1.2-mm dust clumps than those 6.7-GHz methanol masers with lower luminosities. We suggest that this indicates that more luminous 6.7-GHz methanol masers are generally associated with a later evolutionary phase of massive star formation than less luminous 6.7-GHz methanol maser sources. Analysis of the 6.7-GHz associated 1.2-mm dust clumps with and without associated 12.2-GHz methanol maser emission shows that clumps associated with both class II methanol maser transitions are less dense than those with no associated 12.2-GHz methanol maser emission. Furthermore, 12.2-GHz methanol masers are preferentially detected towards 6.7-GHz methanol masers with associated OH masers, suggesting that 12.2-GHz methanol masers are associated with a later evolutionary phase of massive star formation. We have compared the colours of the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE) point sources associated with the maser sources in the following two subgroups: 6.7-GHz methanol masers with and without associated 12.2-GHz methanol masers; and 6.7-GHz methanol masers with high- and those with low-peak luminosities. There is little difference in the nature of the associated GLIMPSE point sources in any of these subgroups, and we propose that the masers themselves are probably much more sensitive than mid-infrared data to evolutionary changes in the massive star formation regions that they are associated with. We present an evolutionary sequence for masers in high-mass star formation regions, placing quantitative estimates on the relative lifetimes for the first time.},

	Abstract = {Continuum emission and H110-alpha recombination line emission from Sgr B1 and G0.6-0.0 have been observed using the VLA. It is shown that Sgr B1 is a region of great complexity, both spatially and kinematically. The continuum observations show that this region is dominated by many extended features rather than compact sources. On the other hand, Sgr B2 is dominated by several ultracompact H II regions. The two regions may be in different stages of evolution, with Sgr B1 being older, perhaps by as much as 0 exp 6 yrs. The recombination line study shows that Sgr B1 is composed of two distinct kinematic regions, a simple western one and a more complex eastern one. G0.6-0.0 is a region composed of at least four ultracompact H II regions that is situated between Sgr B1 and Sgr B2. There is an arc of ionized gas that lies to the east and to the south of these compact regions. The velocity of G0.6-0.0 is intermediate between those of Sgr B1 and Sgr B2. These facts strengthen the argument that these regions are physically associated.},

	Abstract = {The radio continuum toward the Sgr B2 region of star formation has been imaged at a wavelength of 1.3 cm with a spatial resolution of ≍2000 AU (0".25) and a sensitivity of ≍0.4 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>. These high-quality images show many newly detected continuum components and reveal remarkable features associated with several previously known H II regions. Current models of ultracompact H II regions are discussed within the context of these new data. The images detail 49 individual continuum components within the Sgr B2 complex. Half of these have diameters less than 5000 AU, including several unresolved components (diameters &lt;2100 AU). These H II regions may be explained by a disk photoevaporation model. There are many asymmetrically bright shell-like and arclike H II regions in Sgr B2. The asymmetries observed in the 1.3 cm continuum from these shell-like and arclike H II regions correspond to gradients in the 20 cm → 1.3 cm spectral indices, reflecting gradients in the electron densities within many of these H II regions. These shell- and arclike sources may be best described by an "improved" champagne flow model, incorporating stellar winds and significant gradients in the density of ambient neutral material. Numerous filamentary structures are seen in images of the long-tail cometary H II region Sgr B2 I. At least three components are identified in the tail region exhibiting two different position angles on the plane of the sky. The morphology may result from an interaction between the ionized gas of Sgr B2 I and external winds which originate within the nearby Sgr B2 F cluster of H II regions.},

We propose a new method to determine the age of a large sample of OB associations by investigating the development of their associated H ii regions in the surrounding turbulent medium. <BR /> Methods: Using analytical solutions, one-dimensional (1D), and three-dimensional (3D) simulations, we constrained the expansion of the ionized bubble depending on the turbulence level of the parent molecular cloud. A grid of 1D simulations was then computed in order to build isochrone curves for H ii regions in a pressure-size diagram. This grid of models allowed us to date a large sample of OB associations that we obtained from the H ii Region Discovery Survey (HRDS). <BR /> Results: Analytical solutions and numerical simulations showed that the expansion of H ii regions is slowed down by the turbulence up to the point where the pressure of the ionized gas is in a quasi-equilibrium with the turbulent ram pressure. Based on this result, we built a grid of 1D models of the expansion of H ii regions in a profile based on Larson's laws. We take the 3D turbulence into account with an effective 1D temperature profile. The ages estimated by the isochrones of this grid agree well with literature values of well known regions such as Rosette, RCW 36, RCW 79, and M 16. We thus propose that this method can be used to find ages of young OB associations through the Galaxy and also in nearby extra-galactic sources.},

	Abstract = {We adopt the deep learning method called the Convolutional Approach to Shell Identification (casi) and extend it to 3D (casi-3d) to identify signatures of stellar feedback in molecular line spectra. We use magnetohydrodynamics simulations modeling the impact of stellar winds in a turbulent molecular cloud to generate synthetic <SUP>13</SUP>CO (J = 1 - 0) observations. We train two casi-3d models: ME1 predicts only the position of feedback, while MF predicts the fraction of the mass coming from feedback in each voxel. We adopt 75% of the synthetic observations as the training set and assess the accuracy of the two models with the remaining data. Both models identify bubbles in simulated data within 5% error. We use bubbles previously visually identified in Taurus in <SUP>13</SUP>CO to validate the models and show that both perform well on the highest confidence bubbles. Models ME1 and MF predict total feedback gas mass of 2894 M<SUB>☉</SUB> and 302 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, respectively. After correcting for missing energy due to the limited velocity range, model ME1 predicts feedback kinetic energies of 4.0 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg and 1.5 × 10<SUP>47</SUP> erg with and without subtracting the cloud velocity gradient. Model MF predicts feedback kinetic energies of 9.6 × 10<SUP>45</SUP> erg and 2.8 × 10<SUP>46</SUP> erg with and without subtracting the cloud velocity gradient. Model ME1 predicts bubble locations and properties consistent with previous visual identifications. However, model MF demonstrates that feedback properties computed using visual identifications significantly overestimate feedback impact, due to line-of-sight confusion and contamination from background and foreground gas.},

	Abstract = {We present SiO J = 2-1 maps of the Sgr B2 molecular cloud, which show shocked gas with a turbulent substructure comprising at least three cavities at velocities of $[10,40]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ and an arc at velocities of $[-20,10]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ . The spatial anticorrelation of shocked gas at low and high velocities, and the presence of bridging features in position-velocity diagrams suggest that these structures formed in a cloud-cloud collision. Some of the known compact H II regions spatially overlap with sites of strong SiO emission at velocities of $[40,85]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , and are between or along the edges of SiO gas features at $[100,120]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , suggesting that the stars responsible for ionizing the compact H II regions formed in compressed gas due to this collision. We find gas densities and kinetic temperatures of the order of $n_ \rm H_2 \sim 10^5\, \rm cm^ -3 $ and $\sim 30\, \rm K$ , respectively, towards three positions of Sgr B2. The average values of the SiO relative abundances, integrated line intensities, and line widths are ∼10<SUP>-9</SUP>, $\sim 11\, \rm K\, km\, s^ -1 $ , and $\sim 31\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , respectively. These values agree with those obtained with chemical models that mimic grain sputtering by C-type shocks. A comparison of our observations with hydrodynamical simulations shows that a cloud-cloud collision that took place $\lesssim 0.5\, \rm Myr$ ago can explain the density distribution with a mean column density of $\bar N _ \rm H_2 \gtrsim 5\times 10^ 22 \, \rm cm^ -2 $ , and the morphology and kinematics of shocked gas in different velocity channels. Colliding clouds are efficient at producing internal shocks with velocities $\sim 5\!-\!50\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ . High-velocity shocks are produced during the early stages of the collision and can readily ignite star formation, while moderate- and low-velocity shocks are important over longer time-scales and can explain the widespread SiO emission in Sgr B2.},

	Abstract = {The probability distribution function of column density (PDF) has become the tool of choice for cloud structure analysis and star formation studies. Its simplicity is attractive, and the PDF could offer access to cloud physical parameters otherwise difficult to measure, but there has been some confusion in the literature on the definition of its completeness limit and shape at the low column density end. In this letter we use the natural definition of the completeness limit of a column density PDF, the last closed column density contour inside a surveyed region, and apply it to a set of large-scale maps of nearby molecular clouds. We conclude that there is no observational evidence for log-normal PDFs in these objects. We find that all studied molecular clouds have PDFs well described by power laws, including the diffuse cloud Polaris. Our results call for a new physical interpretation of the shape of the column density PDFs. We find that the slope of a cloud PDF is invariant to distance but not to the spatial arrangement of cloud material, and as such it is still a useful tool for investigating cloud structure.},

	Abstract = {In this Letter we investigate the shape of the probability distribution of column densities (PDF) in molecular clouds. Through the use of low-noise, extinction-calibrated Herschel/Planck emission data for eight molecular clouds, we demonstrate that, contrary to common belief, the PDFs of molecular clouds are not described well by log-normal functions, but are instead power laws with exponents close to two and with breaks between A<SUB>K</SUB> ≃ 0.1 and 0.2 mag, so close to the CO self-shielding limit and not far from the transition between molecular and atomic gas. Additionally, we argue that the intrinsic functional form of the PDF cannot be securely determined below A<SUB>K</SUB> ≃ 0.1 mag, limiting our ability to investigate more complex models for the shape of the cloud PDF.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery and characterization of a power-law correlation between the local surface densities of Spitzer-identified, dusty young stellar objects (YSOs) and the column density of gas (as traced by near-IR extinction) in eight molecular clouds within 1 kpc and with 100 or more known YSOs. This correlation, which appears in data smoothed over size scales of ~1 pc, varies in quality from cloud to cloud; those clouds with tight correlations, MonR2 and Ophiuchus, are fit with power laws of slope 2.67 and 1.87, respectively. The spread in the correlation is attributed primarily to local gas disruption by stars that formed there or to the presence of very young subregions at the onset of star formation. We explore the ratio of the number of Class II to Class I sources, a proxy for the star formation age of a region, as a function of gas column density; this analysis reveals a declining Class II to Class I ratio with increasing column density. We show that the observed star-gas correlation is consistent with a star formation law where the star formation rate per area varies with the gas column density squared. We also propose a simple picture of thermal fragmentation of dense gas in an isothermal, self-gravitating layer as an explanation for the power law. Finally, we briefly compare the star-gas correlation and its implied star formation law with other recent proposed of star formation laws at similar and larger size scales from nearby star-forming regions.},

Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) to map the bright Huygens region of the star-forming region M42 with a resolution of 9'' and a sensitivity of 2.8 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP>. Ninety GHz is an interesting transition frequency, as MUSTANG detects both the free-free emission characteristic of the H II region created by the Trapezium stars, normally seen at lower frequencies, and thermal dust emission from the background OMC1 molecular cloud, normally mapped at higher frequencies. We also present similar data from the 150 GHz GISMO camera taken on the IRAM 30 m telescope. This map has 15'' resolution. By combining the MUSTANG data with 1.4, 8, and 21 GHz radio data from the VLA and GBT, we derive a new estimate of the emission measure averaged electron temperature of T<SUB>e</SUB> = 11376 $\pm$ 1050 K by an original method relating free-free emission intensities at optically thin and optically thick frequencies. Combining Infrared Space Observatory-long wavelength spectrometer (ISO-LWS) data with our data, we derive a new estimate of the dust temperature and spectral emissivity index within the 80'' ISO-LWS beam toward Orion KL/BN, T<SUB>d</SUB> = 42 $\pm$ 3 K and β<SUB> d </SUB> = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.1. We show that both T<SUB>d</SUB> and β<SUB> d </SUB> decrease when going from the H II region and excited OMC1 interface to the denser UV shielded part of OMC1 (Orion KL/BN, Orion S). With a model consisting of only free-free and thermal dust emission, we are able to fit data taken at frequencies from 1.5 GHz to 854 GHz (350 μm).},

	Abstract = {The structure of interstellar shocks driven by supernova remnants and by expanding H II regions around early-type stars is discussed. Jump conditions are examined, along with shock fronts, post-shock relaxation layers, collisional shocks, collisionless shocks, nonradiative shocks, radiative atomic shocks, and shock models of observed nebulae. Effects of shock waves on interstellar molecules are examined, with reference to the chemistry behind shock fronts, infrared and vibrational-rotational cooling by molecules, and observations of shocked molecules. Some current problems and applications of the study of interstellar shocks are summarized, including the initiation of star formation by radiative shock waves, interstellar masers, the stability of shocks, particle acceleration in shocks, and shocks in galactic nuclei.},

	Abstract = {Context. The giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2 (hereafter Sgr B2) is the most massive region with ongoing high-mass star formation in the Galaxy. In the southern region of the 40-pc large envelope of Sgr B2, we encounter the Sgr B2(DS) region, which hosts more than 60 high-mass protostellar cores distributed in an arc shape around an extended H II region. Hints of non-thermal emission have been found in the H II region associated with Sgr B2(DS). <BR /> Aims: We seek to characterize the spatial structure and the spectral energy distribution of the radio continuum emission in Sgr B2(DS). We aim to disentangle the contribution from the thermal and non-thermal radiation, as well as to study the origin of the non-thermal radiation. <BR /> Methods: We used the Very Large Array in its CnB and D configurations, and in the frequency bands C (4-8 GHz) and X (8-12 GHz) to observe the whole Sgr B2 complex. Continuum and radio recombination line maps are obtained. <BR /> Results: We detect radio continuum emission in Sgr B2(DS) in a bubble-shaped structure. From 4 to 12 GHz, we derive a spectral index between - 1.2 and - 0.4, indicating the presence of non-thermal emission. We decomposed the contribution from thermal and non-thermal emission, and find that the thermal component is clumpy and more concentrated, while the non-thermal component is more extended and diffuse. The radio recombination lines in the region are found to be not in local thermodynamic equilibrium but stimulated by the non-thermal emission. <BR /> Conclusions: Sgr B2(DS) shows a mixture of thermal and non-thermal emission at radio wavelengths. The thermal free-free emission is likely tracing an H II region ionized by an O 7 star, while the non-thermal emission can be generated by relativistic electrons created through first-order Fermi acceleration. We have developed a simple model of the Sgr B2(DS) region and found that first-order Fermi acceleration can reproduce the observed flux density and spectral index.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiwavelength investigation of star formation activity toward the southern H II regions associated with IRAS 17160-3707, located at a distance of 6.2 kpc with a bolometric luminosity of 8.3 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> L <SUB>☉</SUB>. The ionized gas distribution and dust clumps in the parental molecular cloud are examined in detail using measurements at infrared, submillimeter and radio wavelengths. The radio continuum images at 1280 and 610 MHz obtained using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope reveal the presence of multiple compact sources as well as nebulous emission. At submillimeter wavelengths, we identify seven dust clumps and estimate their physical properties such as temperature: 24-30 K, mass: 300-4800 M <SUB>☉</SUB> and luminosity: 9-317 × 10<SUP>2</SUP> L <SUB>☉</SUB> using modified blackbody fits to the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) between 70 and 870 μm. We find 24 young stellar objects (YSOs) in the mid-infrared, with a few of them coincident with the compact radio sources. The SEDs of the YSOs have been fitted by the Robitaille models and the results indicate that those having radio compact sources as counterparts host massive objects in early evolutionary stages with best fit age ≤0.2 Myr. We compare the relative evolutionary stages of clumps using various signposts such as masers, ionized gas, presence of YSOs and infrared nebulosity, and find six massive star-forming clumps and one quiescent clump. Of the former, five are in a relatively advanced stage and one in an earlier stage.},

@article{Padovani:2019aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Radio observations at metre-centimetre wavelengths shed light on the nature of the emission of H II regions. Usually this category of objects is dominated by thermal radiation produced by ionised hydrogen, namely protons and electrons. However, a number of observational studies have revealed the existence of H II regions with a mixture of thermal and non-thermal radiation. The latter represents a clue as to the presence of relativistic electrons. However, neither the interstellar cosmic-ray electron flux nor the flux of secondary electrons, produced by primary cosmic rays through ionisation processes, is high enough to explain the observed flux densities. <BR /> Aims: We investigate the possibility of accelerating local thermal electrons up to relativistic energies in H II region shocks. <BR /> Methods: We assumed that relativistic electrons can be accelerated through the first-order Fermi acceleration mechanism and we estimated the emerging electron fluxes, the corresponding flux densities, and the spectral indexes. <BR /> Results: We find flux densities of the same order of magnitude of those observed. In particular, we applied our model to the "deep south" (DS) region of Sagittarius B2 and we succeeded in reproducing the observed flux densities with an accuracy of less than 20% as well as the spectral indexes. The model also gives constraints on magnetic field strength (0.3-4 mG), density (1-9 × 10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>), and flow velocity in the shock reference frame (33-50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) expected in DS. <BR /> Conclusions: We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate thermal electrons inside H II regions through the first-order Fermi acceleration. The existence of a local source of relativistic electrons can explain the origin of both the observed non-thermal emission and the corresponding spectral indexes.},

@proceedings{:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The Protostars and Planets book and conference series has been a long-standing tradition that commenced with the first meeting led by Tom Gehrels and held in Tucson, Arizona, in 1978. The goal then, as it still is today, was to bridge the gap between the fields of star and planet formation as well as the investigation of planetary systems and planets. As Tom Gehrels stated in the preface to the first Protostars and Planets book, "Cross-fertilization of information and understanding is bound to occur when investigators who are familiar with the stellar and interstellar phases meet with those who study the early phases of solar system formation." The central goal remained the same for the subsequent editions of the books and conferences Protostars and Planets II in 1984, Protostars and Planets III in 1990, Protostars and Planets IV in 1998, and Protostars and Planets V in 2005, but has now been greatly expanded by the flood of new discoveries in the field of exoplanet science. The original concept of the Protostars and Planets series also formed the basis for the sixth conference in the series, which took place on July 15-20, 2013. It was held for the first time outside of the United States in the bustling university town of Heidelberg, Germany. The meeting attracted 852 participants from 32 countries, and was centered around 38 review talks and more than 600 posters. The review talks were expanded to form the 38 chapters of this book, written by a total of 250 contributing authors. This Protostars and Planets volume reflects the current state-of-the-art in star and planet formation, and tightly connects the fields with each other. It is structured into four sections covering key aspects of molecular cloud and star formation, disk formation and evolution, planetary systems, and astrophysical conditions for life. All poster presentations from the conference can be found at www.ppvi.org. In the eight years that have passed since the fifth conference and book in the Protostars and Planets series, the field of star and planet formation has progressed enormously. The advent of new space observatories like Spitzer and more recently Herschel have opened entirely new windows to study the interstellar medium, the birthplaces of new stars, and the properties of protoplanetary disks. Millimeter and radio observatories, in particular interferometers, allow us to investigate even the most deeply embedded and youngest protostars. Complementary to these observational achievements, novel multi-scale and multi-physics theoretical and numerical models have provided new insights into the physical and chemical processes that govern the birth of stars and their planetary systems. Sophisticated radiative transfer modeling is critical in order to better connect theories with observations. Since the last Protostars and Planets volume, more than 1000 new extrasolar planets have been identified and there are thousands more waiting to be verified. Such a large database allows for the first time a statistical assessment of the planetary properties as well as their evolution pathways. These investigations show the enormous diversity of the architecture of planetary systems and the properties of planets. High-contrast imaging at short and long wavelengths has resolved protoplanetary disks and associated planets, and transit spectroscopy is a new tool that allows us to study even the physical properties of extrasolar planetary atmospheres. The understanding of our own solar system has also progressed enormously since 2005. For instance, the sample-return Stardust mission has provided direct insight into the composition of comets and asteroids, and has demonstrated the importance of mixing processes in the early solar system. And much more is now known about the origin and role of short-lived nuclides at these stages of the solar system. For generations of astronomers, the Protostars and Planets volumes have served as an essential resource for our understanding of star and planet formation. They are used by students to dive into new topics, and they are much valued by experienced researchers as a comprehensive overview of the field with all its interactions. We hope that you will enjoy reading (and learning from) this book as much as we do. The organization of the Protostars and Planets conference was carried out in close collaboration between the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy and the Center for Astronomy of the University Heidelberg, with generous support from the German Science Foundation. This volume is a product of effort and care by many people. First and foremost, we want to acknowledge the 250 contributing authors, as it is only due to their expertise and knowledge that such a comprehensive review compendium in all its depth and breadth is possible. The Protostars and Planets VI conference and this volume was a major undertaking, with support and contributions by many people and institutions. We like to thank the members of the Scientific Advisory Committee who selected the 38 teams and chapters out of more than 120 submitted proposals. Similarly, we are grateful to the reviewers, who provided valuable input and help to the chapter authors. The book would also not have been possible without the great support of Ren{\'e}e Dotson and other staff from USRA's Lunar and Planetary Institute, who handled the detailed processing of all manuscripts and the production of the book, and of Allyson Carter and other staff from the University of Arizona Press. We are also grateful to Richard Binzel, the General Editor of the Space Science Series, for his constant support during the long process, from the original concept to this final product. Finally, we would like to express a very special thank you to the entire conference local organizing committee, and in particular, Carmen Cuevas and Natali Jurina, for their great commitment to the project and for a very fruitful and enjoyable collaboration. <P />},

	Abstract = {<BR /> Aims: We aim to investigate the chemistry of internal photon-dominated regions (PDRs) surrounding deeply embedded hypercompact (HC) and ultracompact (UC) HII regions. We search for specific tracers of this evolutionary stage of massive star formation that can be detected with current astronomical facilities. <BR /> Methods: We modeled hot cores with embedded HC/UCHII regions (called HII region models in the article despite the fact that we do not model the HII region itself), by coupling the astrochemical code Saptarsy to a radiative transfer framework obtaining the spatio-temporal evolution of abundances as well as time-dependent synthetic spectra. In these models where we focused on the internal PDR surrounding the HII region, the gas temperature is set to the dust temperature and we do not include dynamics thus the density structure is fixed. We compared this to hot molecular core (HMC) models and studied the effect on the chemistry of the radiation field which is included in the HII region models only during the computation of abundances. In addition, we investigated the chemical evolution of the gas surrounding HII regions with models of different densities at the ionization front, different sizes of the ionized cavity and different initial abundances. <BR /> Results: We obtain the time evolution of synthetic spectra for a dozen of selected species as well as ratios of their integrated intensities. We find that some molecules such as C, N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, CN, and HCO do not trace the inner core and so are not good tracers to distinguish the HII/PDR regions to the HMCs phase. On the contrary, C<SUP>+</SUP> and O trace the internal PDRs, in the two models starting with different initial abundances, but are unfortunately currently unobservable with the current achievable spatial resolution because of the very thin internal PDR (∆ r<SUB>PDR</SUB> &lt; 100 AU). The emission of these two tracers is very dependent on the size of the HII region and on the density in the PDR. In addition, we find that the abundance profiles are highly affected by the choice of the initial abundances, hence the importance to properly define them.},

	Abstract = {We present single dish and interferometric maps of several rotational transitions of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N vibrationally excited levels towards Sgr B2. HC<SUB>3</SUB>N is a very suitable molecule to probe hot and dense regions (hot cores) affected by high extinction since its vibrational levels are mainly excited by mid-IR radiation. The single dish maps show, for the first time, that the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N vibrationally excited emission (HC<SUB>3</SUB>N*) is not restricted to Sgr B2M and N but extended over an area 40''x20'' in extent. We distinguish four bright clumps (Sgr B2R1 to B2R4) in the ridge connecting the main cores Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N, and a low brightness extended region to the west of the ridge (Sgr B2W). The physical properties and the kinematics of all hot cores have been derived from the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N* lines. Our high angular resolution images show that the Sgr B2N hot core breaks in two different hot cores, Sgr B2N1 and N2, with different radial velocities and separated by ~ 2 <SUP>''</SUP> in declination. We find that the excitation of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N* emission in all hot cores can be represented by a single temperature and that the linewidth of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N* rotational lines arising from different vibrational levels systematically decreases as the energy of the vibrational level increases. The systematic trend in the linewidth is likely related to the increase of the velocity as the distance to the exciting source increases. We have developed a simple model to study the excitation of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N vibrational levels by IR radiation. We find that the single excitation temperature can be explained by high luminosities of embedded stars ( ~ 10<SUP>7</SUP> L<SUB>sun</SUB>) and small source sizes ( ~ 2-3''). The estimated clump masses are 500 M<SUB>sun</SUB> for Sgr B2M, 800 M<SUB>sun</SUB> for Sgr B2N and 10-30 M<SUB>sun</SUB> for Sgr B2R1 to B2R4. Luminosities are 1-2 10<SUP>6</SUP> L<SUB>sun</SUB> for Sgr B2R1-B2R4 and Sgr B2M and 10<SUP>7</SUP> L<SUB>sun</SUB> for Sgr B2N. We estimate HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundances of 5 10<SUP>-9</SUP> for Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N2 and 10<SUP>-7</SUP> for the rest of the hot cores. The different HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundances in the hot cores reflect different stages of evolution due to time dependent chemistry and/or photo-dissociation by UV radiation from nearby HII regions. According to the mass and the luminosity of the different hot cores, we propose that Sgr B2M and B2N contain a cluster of 20-30 hot cores, each like that in Orion A, a number similar to the UC HII regions already detected in the region. The Sgr B2R1-B2R4 hot cores represent isolated formation of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {We present high angular resolution (13-26") large scale mapping (4'x7') of the J=5-4, J=8-7, and J=12-11 lines of CH_3_CN and CH_3_^13^CN and of the J=11-10 line of HC_3_N towards the Sgr B2 molecular cloud. All the K components of all CH_3_CN lines are observed in emission except towards Sgr B2M where we have detected the J=5-4, K=4 and J=6-5, K=5 lines in absorption. CH_3_CN and HC_3_N show a ridge of strong emission along a north-south direction which contains the star forming regions Sgr B2M, Sgr B2N and Sgr B2S. The kinematics of the molecular gas shows four major molecular clouds with radial velocities of 44-54, 55-66, 67-78 and 90-120km/s and sizes of a few parsecs. The main molecular cloud with a radial velocity of 55-66km/s is observed over the whole region. Maps of the kinetic temperature and density derived from an LVG analysis of the CH_3_CN data are presented for the molecular clouds at 44-54, 55-66 and 67-78km/s. The kinetic temperature for the three clouds ranges between 40-400K, while the density is ~10^5^cm^-3^ for all clouds. The total mass in these clouds is 3.10^6^M<SUB>sun</SUB>_, with 70% of the mass in the 55-66km/s molecular cloud. This cloud reveals the presence of four different components: the hot cores, the warm envelope, the very hot component and the hot ring. The largest kinetic temperatures (200-400K) are found towards the hot cores associated to the star forming regions Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N, with sizes of 0.5 and 0.7pc respectively. Two new cores close to Sgr B2N with sizes of 0.3 pc have been found. H_2_ densities for the hot cores are 10^6^-10^7^cm^-3^. The mass in the cores is typically 10^3^-10^4^M<SUB>sun</SUB>_. The warm envelope extends over the whole region; this has a uniform kinetic temperature, between 40-80K. The kinetic temperatures are higher than the dust temperatures at distances larger than 1pc. The density in the warm envelope decreases with distance as n(H_2_)=2.96x10^5^cm^-3^(r/pc)^-0.87^. The analysis of the absorption lines in the J=K components of the J=5-4 and J=6-5 lines shows the presence of a hotter and more diffuse envelope probably surrounding the warm envelope. An analysis of our data gives a kinetic temperature of 300K and a density of ~10^3^cm^-3^. The kinetic temperature maps reveal, for the first time, the presence of a ring of hot gas (100-120K) surrounding Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N with a radius of 2pc and a thickness of 1.4pc. Our data suggest that the density in the hot ring is similar to that in the warm envelope. The high temperature of the hot cores and the kinetic temperature distribution for distances smaller than 1pc can be accounted for by gas-dust collisional heating. This temperature is consistent with the total luminosity of the central sources Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N. In contrast, the dust temperatures in the warm envelope are too low (10-20K) to heat the warm envelope molecular gas by this mechanism. Heating by dissipation of turbulent motions in the envelope of Sgr B2 can explain the high gas kinetic temperatures. The presence of the hot ring suggests the existence of another heating mechanism. The morphology of the hot ring which surrounds the 50μm and the radio continuum emission of Sgr B2M and Sgr B2N suggests that this feature might be associated to the interface between the warm envelope and the ionized bubble created by the OB stars recently formed in the Sgr B2 core. In this interface, heating by UV photons and or shock fronts produced by the expansion of the ionized gas could explain the hot ring.},

	Abstract = {Accretion flows onto massive stars must transfer mass so quickly that they are themselves gravitationally unstable, forming dense clumps and filaments. These density perturbations interact with young massive stars, emitting ionizing radiation, alternately exposing and confining their H II regions. As a result, the H II regions are predicted to flicker in flux density over periods of decades to centuries rather than increase monotonically in size as predicted by simple Spitzer solutions. We have recently observed the Sgr B2 region at 1.3 cm with the Very Large Array in its three hybrid configurations (DnC, CnB, and BnA) at a resolution of ~0.''25. These observations were made to compare in detail with matched continuum observations from 1989. At 0.''25 resolution, Sgr B2 contains 41 ultracompact (UC) H II regions, 6 of which are hypercompact. The new observations of Sgr B2 allow comparison of relative peak flux densities for the H II regions in Sgr B2 over a 23 year time baseline (1989-2012) in one of the most source-rich massive star forming regions in the Milky Way. The new 1.3 cm continuum images indicate that four of the 41 UC H II regions exhibit significant changes in their peak flux density, with one source (K3) dropping in peak flux density, and the other three sources (F10.303, F1, and F3) increasing in peak flux density. The results are consistent with statistical predictions from simulations of high mass star formation, suggesting that they offer a solution to the lifetime problem for UC H II regions.},

	Abstract = {The massive star-forming region Sgr B2 has been observed with the Very Large Array in all three hybrid configurations at 1.3 cm in the radio recombination lines (RRLs) H66alpha and He66alpha . The observations are sensitive to structures ranging in angular scales from 0\farcs08 to 60\arcsec, which is essential in a region containing ultracompact HII regions and more diffuse ``cometary'' and ``shell'' emission. Line emission has been detected from five continuum sources (Sgr B2 C, E, F, G and K3) where previously only upper limits were known. We present integrated line parameters (velocity resolution ~ 10 km s(-1) ) for each of the detected sources in Sgr B2. For several of the compact sources in the core of Sgr B2, high spatial resolution images will be discussed. Many of the ``shell'' type HII regions have double-peaked emission-line profiles (split by up to 50 km s(-1) ) consistent with expanding shells, and one of the most compact HII regions (source F) has extremely broad lines ( ~ 100 km s(-1) FWHM). The compact HII regions in the core of Sgr B2 exhibit line widths and velocity structures expected for very young HII regions; there is evidence for rotation or outflow in the ionized gas. We present detailed images of the velocity structure in selected core sources and preliminary physical explanations for the observed velocity structures in the context of early star formation. <P />},

	Abstract = {The Galactic center star-forming region Sagittarius B2 Main [Sgr B2 (M)] has been observed with the Very Large Array in the continuum (7 mm and 1.3 cm) and in the radio recombination lines H52α, H66α, and He 66α. The H66α(∼0".25 resolution) and H52α(∼2".5 resolution) data provide high spatial resolution kinematics of the ionized gas associated with the massive stars. Both high spatial resolution and sensitivity to large-scale structures are essential to thoroughly sample the H II regions in Sgr B2 (M) where source sizes of the 36 H II regions range from unresolved (&lt;0".3) to extended (∼10"). H66α recombination line emission has been detected toward 23 of the 36 continuum sources in Sgr B2 (M). The mean velocity of the detected sources is 62$\pm$2 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>. He 66α line emission is detected toward nine of the 36 continuum sources. The 1.3 cm helium and hydrogen data are used together as a high-resolution probe of Y<SUP>+</SUP> values and variations within Sgr B2 (M). An average singly ionized helium abundance of &lt;Y<SUP>+</SUP>&gt; = 10.3%$\pm$1.2% is derived. Of the sources where a Y<SUP>+</SUP> value is determined, only Sgr B2 F has an anomalously low value (Y<SUP>+</SUP> ≤ 5%). <P />The recombination line data are examined in detail toward several of the most unusual sources. A very broad radio recombination line (∆V<SUB>H66α</SUB> ∼ 64 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, ∆V<SUB>H52α</SUB> ∼ 59 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is measured, and high electron temperatures [T<SUB>e(H66α)</SUB><SUP>*</SUP> = 26,400 K] are derived for Sgr B2 F. The broad lines and high temperatures may be due to a nonequilibrium environment at the edge of an expanding H II region. Assuming that the F and G H II regions have expanded in a dense molecular environment, they appear to be young, with an average age of &lt;τ&gt; = 0.7$\pm$0.3 x 10<SUP>4</SUP> yr. This lower limit on the age is consistent with the dynamical age of the nearby massive molecular outflow observed by Lis et al. A doubly peaked H66α line has been detected toward the ultracompact H II (UC HII) region Z10.24. This source may be either a very young (τ &lt; 100 yr) shell source or the ionized base of a molecular outflow. The small number of morphological cometary H II regions in Sgr B2 (&lt;5%) and the observed velocity gradients in those regions that do have a cometary morphology indicate that the moving star bow shock model cannot account for any of the H II regions in Sgr B2 (M).},

	Abstract = {We have observed the Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) North star-forming region with the Very Large Array in the continuum (1.3 cm) and in the radio recombination lines H66α and He66α. Sgr B2 North contains regions of ionized gas ranging in size from unresolved (d &lt; 0.01 pc) to extended (d ∼ 0.5 pc) and thus presents an ideal laboratory to study the effects of circumstellar environments on H II region evolution.

We detect no radio recombination line emission (T<SUB>l</SUB>/T<SUB>c</SUB> &lt; 3%) from the ultracompact H ii region K2, which is cospatial in projection with the dynamical center of a bipolar molecular outflow imaged in HC<SUB>3</SUB>N (Lis et al. 1993). The recombination line velocities of K1 and K3 agree with the north-south rotation in molecular gas observed by Lis et al. (1993). Source L is an "arclike" region with a large velocity gradient of ∼70 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP> perpendicular to its edge-brightened rim. The large velocity gradient at this orientation observed in Sgr B2 L may be due to rotation of the ionized gas around ∼150-200M<SUB>sun</SUB>, consisting of low-mass stars.},

	Abstract = {We present large-scale 9<SUP>'</SUP>×27<SUP>'</SUP> (~25pc×70pc) far-IR observations around Sgr B2 using the Long-Wavelength Spectrometer (LWS) on board the Infrared Space Observatory (ISO). The spectra are dominated by the strong continuum emission of dust, the widespread molecular absorption of light hydrides (OH, CH, and H<SUB>2</SUB>O), and the fine-structure lines of [N II], [N III], [O III], [C II], and [O I]. The widespread dust emission is reproduced by a cold component (T<SUB>d</SUB>~=13-22 K) together with a warm component (T<SUB>d</SUB>~=24-38 K), representing &lt;~10% of the dust opacity. The fine-structure line emission reveals a very extended component of ionized gas. The [O III] 52 μm/88 μm and [N III] 57 μm/[N II] 122 μm line intensity ratios show that the ionized gas has an average electron density of ~240 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. The ionizing radiation can be characterized by a hard but diluted continuum, with effective temperatures of ~36,000 K and a Lyman continuum photon flux of ~10<SUP>50.4</SUP> s<SUP>-1</SUP>. The spatial distribution of the ionizing sources with respect to the extended cloud and the clumpiness of the medium determine the large-scale effects of the radiation. Photodissociation regions (PDRs) can be numerous at the interface of the ionized and neutral gas. The analysis of the [C II] 158 μm and [O I] 63 and 145 μm lines indicates a far-UV radiation field of G<SUB>0</SUB>~=10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> and a density of n<SUB>H</SUB>=10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> in these PDRs. The widespread OH lines are reproduced by nonlocal radiative transfer models for clouds of moderate volume density (n<SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB></SUB>~=10<SUP>3</SUP>-10<SUP>4</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) at T<SUB>k</SUB>&gt;~40-100 K. PDR models can explain the enhanced column density of species such as H<SUB>2</SUB>O, OH, and O<SUP>0</SUP>. However, they fail to reproduce the observed NH<SUB>3</SUB>/NH<SUB>2</SUB>/NH~=100/10/1 abundance ratios. For N-bearing species, it seems that shock chemistry has to be invoked. The molecular richness in the outer layers of Sgr B2 is probed by the ISO/LWS Fabry-P{\'e}rot (~35 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) detections toward Sgr B2(M), where more than 70 lines from 15 molecular and atomic species are observed at high signal-to-noise ratios. <P />Based on observations with the Infrared Space Observatory, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the principal investigator countries: France, Germany, Netherlands, and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

	Abstract = {Measurements of seven metastable NH_3_ inversion transitions with (J,K)=(8,8), (9,9), (10,10), (11,11), (12,12), (13,13) and (14,14) are presented. These lines arise from energy levels between ~600K and ~2000K above the ground state, and are found in absorption toward the HII regions SgrB2(M) and (N) at v_LSR_'s between ~60 and ~82km/s. Toward SgrB2(N), there is absorption at v_LSR_~0km/s also. The metastable (J=K) inversion lines are collisionally excited, and an analysis indicates that kinetic temperatures are &gt;600K. The doublet levels are very subthermally excited, with excitation temperatures &lt;10K. Thus, these lines must arise from the low density, n(H_2_)&lt;5 10^3^cm^-3^, extended envelope of SgrB2. In addition, we have measured absorption spectra for the v=0, J=1-0 transition of SiO and the J=4-3 transition of HC_3_N toward both sources. The absorptions are seen at v_LSR_'s of ~0, and between 60 and 85km/s, although the HC_3_N absorption SgrB2(N) is weak and blended with emission. LVG analyses of SiO and the HC_3_N data are consistent with H_2_ densities &lt;5000cm^-3^. Both the NH_3_ and SiO results are consistent with heating by C shocks. These data strongly indicate that the v_LSR_~0km/s component is located close to the galactic center.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic center is the closest region where we can study star formation under extreme physical conditions like those in high-redshift galaxies. <BR /> Aims: We measure the temperature of the dense gas in the central molecular zone (CMZ) and examine what drives it. <BR /> Methods: We mapped the inner 300 pc of the CMZ in the temperature-sensitive J = 3-2 para-formaldehyde (p - H<SUB>2</SUB>CO) transitions. We used the 3<SUB>2,1</SUB>-2<SUB>2,0</SUB>/ 3<SUB>0,3</SUB>-2<SUB>0,2</SUB> line ratio to determine the gas temperature in n ~ 10<SUP>4</SUP>-10<SUP>5</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP> gas. We have produced temperature maps and cubes with 30'' and 1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> resolution and published all data in FITS form. <BR /> Results: Dense gas temperatures in the Galactic center range from ~60 K to &gt;100 K in selected regions. The highest gas temperatures T<SUB>G</SUB>&gt; 100 K are observed around the Sgr B2 cores, in the extended Sgr B2 cloud, the 20 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> clouds, and in "The Brick" (G0.253+0.016). We infer an upper limit on the cosmic ray ionization rate ζ<SUB>CR</SUB>&lt; 10<SUP>-14</SUP>s<SUP>-1</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: The dense molecular gas temperature of the region around our Galactic center is similar to values found in the central regions of other galaxies, in particular starburst systems. The gas temperature is uniformly higher than the dust temperature, confirming that dust is a coolant in the dense gas. Turbulent heating can readily explain the observed temperatures given the observed line widths. Cosmic rays cannot explain the observed variation in gas temperatures, so CMZ dense gas temperatures are not dominated by cosmic ray heating. The gas temperatures previously observed to be high in the inner ~75 pc are confirmed to be high in the entire CMZ. <P />The data can be accessed from doi:10.7910/DVN/27601 and are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/586/A50">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/586/A50</A>},

	Abstract = {The Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) data for a 6 deg<SUP>2</SUP> region of the Galactic plane containing the Galactic center are analyzed and compared to infrared and radio continuum data. The BGPS 1.1 mm emission consists of clumps interconnected by a network of fainter filaments surrounding cavities, a few of which are filled with diffuse near-IR emission indicating the presence of warm dust or with radio continuum characteristic of H II regions or supernova remnants. New 350 μm images of the environments of the two brightest regions, Sgr A and B, are presented. Sgr B2 is the brightest millimeter-emitting clump in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) and may be forming the closest analog to a super star cluster in the Galaxy. The CMZ contains the highest concentration of millimeter- and submillimeter-emitting dense clumps in the Galaxy. Most 1.1 mm features at positive longitudes are seen in silhouette against the 3.6-24 μm background observed by the Spitzer Space Telescope. However, only a few clumps at negative longitudes are seen in absorption, confirming the hypothesis that positive longitude clumps in the CMZ tend to be on the near side of the Galactic center, consistent with the suspected orientation of the central bar in our Galaxy. Some 1.1 mm cloud surfaces are seen in emission at 8 μm, presumably due to polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. A ~0fdg2 (~30 pc) diameter cavity and infrared bubble between l≈ 0fdg0 and 0fdg2 surround the Arches and Quintuplet clusters and Sgr A. The bubble contains several clumpy dust filaments that point toward Sgr A*; its potential role in their formation is explored. Bania's Clump 2, a feature near l = 3$\,^{\circ}$-3fdg5 which exhibits extremely broad molecular emission lines (∆V&gt; 150 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), contains dozens of 1.1 mm clumps. These clumps are deficient in near- and mid-infrared emission in the Spitzer images when compared to both the inner Galactic plane and the CMZ. Thus, Bania's Clump 2 is either inefficient in forming stars or is in a pre-stellar phase of clump evolution. The Bolocat catalog of 1.1 mm clumps contains 1428 entries in the Galactic center between l = 358fdg5 and l = 4fdg5 of which about 80% are likely to be within about 500 pc of the center. The mass spectrum above about 80 M <SUB>sun</SUB> can be described by a power-law ∆N/∆M = N <SUB>0</SUB> M <SUP>-2.14(+0.1,-0.4)</SUP>. The power-law index is somewhat sensitive to systematic grain temperature variations, may be highly biased by source confusion, and is very sensitive to the spatial filtering inherent in the data acquisition and reduction.},

	Abstract = {The cycling of material from the interstellar medium (ISM) into stars and the return of stellar ejecta into the ISM is the engine that drives the galactic ecology in normal spirals. This ecology is a cornerstone in the formation and evolution of galaxies through cosmic time. There remain major observational and theoretical challenges in determining the processes responsible for converting the low-density, diffuse components of the ISM into dense molecular clouds, forming dense filaments and clumps, fragmenting them into stars, expanding OB associations and bound clusters, and characterizing the feedback that limits the rate and efficiency of star formation. This formidable task can be attacked effectively for the first time thanks to the synergistic combination of new global-scale surveys of the Milky Way from infrared (IR) to radio wavelengths, offering the possibility of bridging the gap between local and extragalactic star-formation studies. The Herschel Space Observatory Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) survey, with its five-band 70-500-μm full Galactic Plane mapping at 6"-36" resolution, is the keystone of a set of continuum surveys that include the Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE)(360)+MIPSGAL@Spitzer, Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX), APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL)@Atacama Pathfinder EXperiment (APEX), Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS)@Caltech Submillimeter Observatory (CSO), and CORNISH@Very Large Array (VLA). This suite enables us to measure the Galactic distribution and physical properties of dust on all scales and in all components of the ISM from diffuse clouds to filamentary complexes and hundreds of thousands of dense clumps. A complementary suite of spectroscopic surveys in various atomic and molecular tracers is providing the chemical fingerprinting of dense clumps and filaments, as well as essential kinematic information to derive distances and thus transform panoramic data into a three-dimensional representation. The latest results emerging from these Galaxy-scale surveys are reviewed. New insights into cloud formation and evolution, filaments and their relationship to channeling gas onto gravitationally-bound clumps, the properties of these clumps, density thresholds for gravitational collapse, and star and cluster formation rates are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The central half kiloparsec region of our Galaxy harbors a variety of phenomena unique to the central environment. This review discusses the observed structure and activity of the interstellar medium in this region in terms of its inevitable inflow toward the center of the Galactic gravitational potential well. A number of dissipative processes lead to a strong concentration of gas into a "Central Molecular Zone" of about 200-pc radius, in which the molecular medium is characterized by large densities, large velocity dispersions, high temperatures, and apparently strong magnetic fields. The physical state of the gas and the resultant star formation processes occurring in this environment are therefore quite unlike those occurring in the large-scale disk. Gas not consumed by star formation either enters a hot X ray-emitting halo and is lost as a thermally driven galactic wind or continues moving inward, probably discontinuously, through the domain of the few parsec-sized circumnuclear disks and eventually into the central parsec. There, the central radio source SgrA* currently accepts only a tiny fraction of the inflowing material, likely as a result of a limit cycle wherein the continual inflow of matter provokes star formation, which in turn can temporarily halt the inflow via mass-outflow winds.},

	Abstract = {We recently proposed that the star-forming potential of dense molecular clouds in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central few 100 pc) of the Milky Way is intimately linked to their orbital dynamics, potentially giving rise to an absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds. In this paper, we present an orbital model for the gas stream(s) observed in the CMZ. The model is obtained by integrating orbits in the empirically constrained gravitational potential and represents a good fit (χ _red^2=2.0) to the observed position-velocity distribution of dense (n &gt; several 10<SUP>3</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) gas, reproducing all of its key properties. The orbit is also consistent with observational constraints not included in the fitting process, such as the 3D space velocities of Sgr B2 and the Arches and Quintuplet clusters. It differs from previous, parametric models in several respects: (1) the orbit is open rather than closed due to the extended mass distribution in the CMZ, (2) its orbital velocity (100-200 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>) is twice as high as in previous models, and (3) Sgr A* coincides with the focus of the (eccentric) orbit rather than being offset. Our orbital solution supports the recently proposed scenario in which the dust ridge between G0.253+0.016 (`the Brick') and Sgr B2 represents an absolute-time sequence of star-forming clouds, of which the condensation was triggered by the tidal compression during their most recent pericentre passage. We position the clouds on a common timeline and find that their pericentre passages occurred 0.30-0.74 Myr ago. Given their short free-fall times (t<SUB>ff</SUB> ∼ 0.34 Myr), the quiescent cloud G0.253+0.016 and the vigorously star-forming complex Sgr B2 are separated by a single free-fall time of evolution, implying that star formation proceeds rapidly once collapse has been initiated. We provide the complete orbital solution, as well as several quantitative predictions of our model (e.g. proper motions and the positions of star formation `hotspots'). The paper is concluded with a discussion of the assumptions and possible caveats, as well as the position of the model in the Galactic context, highlighting its relation to large-scale gas accretion, the dynamics of the bar, the x<SUB>2</SUB> orbital family, and the origin of the Arches and Quintuplet clusters.},

	Abstract = {The physical parameters of HII regions span orders of magnitude in scale. The classes most closely linked to star formation are the smallest, densest, and, presumably, youngest stages: compact, ultracompact, and hypercompact HII regions.Although hypercompact HII regions have been known for over ten years, until recently only a very small number of these regions were known. Moreover, it is only in the past several years that these regions have come to be recognized as a distinct class of HII region and that attempts have been made to understand their place in the scheme of massive star formation.Here we present a summary of the observational studies to date. We give special emphasis to radio continuum studies, which indicate density gradients within the ionized gas, and to radio spectral line studies, which show unusually broad recombination line profiles. Possible interpretations of these aspects of hypercompact HII regions are discussed, and their implications for the interpretation of hypercompact HII regions as an evolutionary stage in the high-mass star formation process. <P />},

	Abstract = {We present radio and infrared observations of four hyper-compact HII regions and four ultra-compact HII regions in the southern Galactic plane. These objects were selected from a blind survey for ultra-compact HII regions using data from two new radio surveys of the southern sky: the Australia Telescope 20GHz survey and the second epoch Molonglo Galactic Plane Survey at 843MHz. To our knowledge, this is the first blind radio survey for hyper- and ultra-compact HII regions. We have followed up these sources with the Australia Telescope Compact Array to obtain H70α recombination line measurements, higher resolution images at 20GHz and flux density measurements at 30, 40 and 95GHz. From this, we have determined sizes and recombination line temperatures as well as modelling the spectral energy distributions to determine emission measures. We have classified the sources as hyper-compact or ultra-compact on the basis of their physical parameters, in comparison with benchmark parameters from the literature. Several of these bright, compact sources are potential calibrators for the low-frequency instrument (30-70GHz) and the 100GHz channel of the high-frequency instrument of the Planck satellite mission. They may also be useful as calibrators for the Australia Telescope Compact Array, which lacks good non-variable primary flux calibrators at higher frequencies and in the Galactic plane region. Our spectral energy distributions allow the flux densities within the Planck bands to be determined, although our high-frequency observations show that several sources have excess emission at 95GHz (3mm) that cannot be explained by current models.},

@article{Beuther:2002aa,
	Abstract = {With the aim of understanding the role of massive outflows in high-mass star formation, we mapped in the <SUP>12</SUP>CO J=2-1 transition 26 high-mass star-forming regions at very early stages of their evolution. At a spatial resolution of 11'' bipolar molecular outflows were found in 21 of them. The other five sources show confusing morphology but strong line wings. This high detection rate of bipolar structure proves that outflows common in low-mass sources are also ubiquitous phenomena in the formation process of massive stars. The flows are large, very massive and energetic, and the data indicate stronger collimation than previously thought. The dynamical timescales of the flows correspond well to the free-fall timescales of the associated cores. Comparing with correlations known for low-mass flows, we find continuity up to the high-mass regime suggesting similar flow-formation scenarios for all masses and luminosities. Accretion rate estimates in the 10<SUP>4</SUP> L<SUB>sun</SUB> range are around 10<SUP>-4</SUP> M<SUB>sun</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, higher than required for low-mass star formation, but consistent with high-mass star formation scenarios. Additionally, we find a tight correlation between the outflow mass and the core mass over many orders of magnitude. The strong correlation between those two quantities implies that the product of the accretion efficiency f<SUB>acc</SUB>=M<SUB>☉</SUB><SUB>acc</SUB>/(M<SUB>core</SUB>/t<SUB>ff</SUB>) and f<SUB>r</SUB> (the ratio between jet mass loss rate and accretion rate), which equals the ratio between jet and core mass (f<SUB>acc</SUB> f<SUB>r</SUB>= M<SUB>jet</SUB>/M<SUB>core</SUB>), is roughly constant for all core masses. This again indicates that the flow-formation processes are similar over a large range of masses. Additionally, we estimate median f<SUB>r</SUB> and f<SUB>acc</SUB> values of approximately 0.2 and 0.01, respectively, which is consistent with current jet-entrainment models. To summarize, the analysis of the bipolar outflow data strongly supports theories which explain massive star formation by scaled up, but otherwise similar physical processes - mainly accretion - to their low-mass counterparts.},

	Abstract = {We present the first systematic study of the density structure of clouds found in a complete sample covering all major molecular clouds in the central molecular zone (CMZ; inner 200 pc) of the Milky Way. This is made possible with data from the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), which is the first study resolving all major molecular clouds in the CMZ at interferometer angular resolution. We find that many CMZ molecular clouds have unusually shallow density gradients compared to regions elsewhere in the Milky Way. This is possibly a consequence of weak gravitational binding of the clouds. The resulting relative absence of dense gas on spatial scales 0.1 pc is probably one of the reasons why star formation (SF) in dense gas of the CMZ is suppressed by a factor 10, compared to solar neighborhood clouds. Another factor suppressing star formation is the high SF density threshold that likely results from the observed gas kinematics. Further, it is possible but not certain that the star formation activity and cloud density structure evolve systematically as clouds orbit the CMZ.},

	Abstract = {The central molecular zone (CMZ; inner 200 pc) of the Milky Way is a star formation (SF) environment with very extreme physical properties. Exploration of SF in this region is important because (I) this region allows us to test models of star formation under exceptional conditions; and (II) the CMZ clouds might be suitable to serve as templates to understand the physics of starburst galaxies in the nearby and the distant universe. For this reason we launched the Galactic Center Molecular Cloud Survey (GCMS), the first systematic study that resolves all major CMZ clouds at interferometer angular resolution (I.e., a few arc seconds). Here we present initial results based on observations with the Submillimeter Array (SMA) and the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). Our study is complemented by dust emission data from the Herschel Space Telescope and a comprehensive literature survey of CMZ star formation activity. Our research reveals (I) an unusually steep linewidth-size relation, σ(v) ∝ r<SUB>eff</SUB><SUP>0.66$\pm$0.18</SUP>, down to velocity dispersions 0.6 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 0.1 pc scale. This scaling law potentially results from the decay of gas motions to transonic velocities in strong shocks. The data also show that, relative to dense gas in the solar neighborhood, (II) star formation is suppressed by factors ≳ 10 in individual CMZ clouds.

	Abstract = {We investigate the physics of gas accretion in young stellar clusters. Accretion in clusters is a dynamic phenomenon as both the stars and the gas respond to the same gravitational potential. Accretion rates are highly non-uniform with stars nearer the centre of the cluster, where gas densities are higher, accreting more than others. This competitive accretion naturally results in both initial mass segregation and a spectrum of stellar masses. Accretion in gas-dominated clusters is well modelled using a tidal-lobe radius instead of the commonly used Bondi-Hoyle accretion radius. This works as both the stellar and gas velocities are under the influence of the same gravitational potential and are thus comparable. The low relative velocity which results means that R<SUB>tidal</SUB>&lt;R<SUB>BH</SUB> in these systems. In contrast, when the stars dominate the potential and are virialized, R<SUB>BH</SUB>&lt;R<SUB>tidal</SUB> and Bondi-Hoyle accretion is a better fit to the accretion rates.},

	Abstract = {The collapse of massive molecular clumps can produce high mass stars, but the evolution is not simply a scaled-up version of low mass star formation. Outflows and radiative effects strongly hinder the formation of massive stars via accretion. A necessary condition for accretion growth of a hydrostatic object up to high masses M &gt; 20 MSun (rather than coalescence of optically thick objects) is the formation of, and accretion through, a circumstellar disk. Once the central object has accreted approximately 10 MSun it has already evolved to core hydrogen-burning; the resultant main sequence star continues to accrete material as it begins to photoevaporate its circumstellar disk (and any nearby disks) on a timescale of ~10^5 years, similar to the accretion timescale. Until the disk(s) is (are) completely photoevaporated, this configuration is observable as an ultra-compact HII region. The final mass of the central star (and any nearby neighboring systems) is determined by the interplay between radiation acceleration, UV photoevaporation, stellar winds and outflows, and the accretion through the disk. Several aspects of this evolutionary sequence have been simulated numerically, resulting in a `proof of concept'. This scenario places strong constraints on the accretion rate necessary to produce high mass stars and offers an opportunity to test the accretion hypothesis. <P />},

	Abstract = {Observations indicate that massive stars in the Galaxy form in regions of very high surface density, Σ~1 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>. Clusters containing massive stars and globular clusters have a column density comparable to this. The total pressure in clouds of such a column density is P/k~10<SUP>8</SUP>-10<SUP>9</SUP> K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, far greater than that in the diffuse interstellar medium or the average in giant molecular clouds. Observations show that massive-star-forming regions are supersonically turbulent, and we show that the molecular cores out of which individual massive stars form are as well. The protostellar accretion rate in such a core is approximately equal to the instantaneous mass of the star divided by the free-fall time of the gas that is accreting onto the star, as described by Stahler, Shu, &amp; Taam. The star formation time in this turbulent core model for massive-star formation is several times the mean free-fall time of the core out of which the star forms but is about equal to that of the region in which the core is embedded. The high densities in regions of massive-star formation lead to typical timescales for the formation of a massive star of about 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr. The corresponding accretion rate is high enough to overcome the radiation pressure due to the luminosity of the star. For the typical case we consider, in which the cores out of which the stars form have a density structure ρ~r<SUP>-1.5</SUP>, the protostellar accretion rate grows with time as m<SUB>*</SUB>~t. We present a new calculation of the evolution of the radius of a protostar and determine the protostellar accretion luminosity. At the high accretion rates that are typical in regions of massive-star formation, protostars join the main sequence at about 20 M<SUB>solar</SUB>. We apply these results to predict the properties of protostars thought to be powering several observed hot molecular cores, including the Orion hot core and W3(H<SUB>2</SUB>O). In the appendices we discuss the pressure in molecular clouds and argue that ``logatropic'' models for molecular clouds are incompatible with observation.},

	Abstract = {Absolute parameters of 509 main-sequence stars selected from the components of detached eclipsing spectroscopic binaries in the solar neighbourhood are used to study mass-luminosity, mass-radius, and mass-effective temperature relations (MLR, MRR, and MTR). The MLR function is found better if expressed by a six-piece classical MLR (L ∝ M<SUP>α</SUP>) rather than a fifth or a sixth degree polynomial within the mass range of 0.179 ≤ M/M<SUB>☉</SUB> ≤ 31. The break points separating the mass ranges with classical MLR do not appear to us to be arbitrary. Instead, the data indicate abrupt changes along the mass axis in the mean energy generation per unit of stellar mass. Unlike the MLR function, the MRR and MTR functions cannot be determined over the full range of masses. A single-piece MRR function is calibrated from the radii of stars with M≤1.5 M_ ☉ , while a second single-piece MTR function is found for stars with M&gt; 1.5 M_ ☉ . The missing part of the MRR is computed from the MLR and MTR, while the missing part of the MTR is computed from the MLR and MRR. As a result, we have interrelated the MLR, MRR, and MTR, which are useful in determining the typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars of given masses. These functions are also useful to estimate typical absolute physical parameters from typical T<SUB>eff</SUB> values. Thus, we were able to estimate the typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars observed in the Sejong Open cluster Survey, based on that survey's published values for T<SUB>eff</SUB>. Since typical absolute physical parameters of main-sequence stars cannot normally be determined in such photometric surveys, the interrelated functions are shown to be useful to compute such missing parameters from similar surveys.},

	Abstract = {This work presents studies of nearby (&lt; 500 pc) dense molecular cloud cores, the sites of low-mass star formation. The sample includes starless and protostellar cores and allows to compare their properties in a homogenous manner. All of the projects presented here are related to an extensive dust thermal continuum emission imaging survey at 1.2 mm wavelength that probes the mass distribution of dense cores. Many of them are also related to the Spitzer Legacy Project "From Molecular Cores to Planet Forming Disks" (c2d) that stimulated the dust emission survey and provided a general framework for my thesis. The main body of this work discusses the dust emission survey and the properties and nature of an unusually faint (&lt; 0.1 L_sun ) source that is apparently embedded in one of the dense cores surveyed. The data from the dust emission survey is used to study the physical state and evolution of starless cores, "normal" protostars, and of the recently discovered Very Low Luminosity Objects (VeLLOs). This is the first study probing VeLLO dense core properties homogeneously for a larger sample of sources. Given that this survey covers both starless and protostellar cores, it is well suited to perform comparative studies. The aim is to understand how the mass distribution in dense cores controls the presence or absence of active star formation. As part of this effort I infer conditions that are necessary (but not sufficient) for active star formation to be possible. These can be understood as a consequence of the quasistatic evolution of a dense core, but do not conclusively imply the latter. Most VeLLO cores fulfil these conditions, questioning the notion that some VeLLOs form in cores that are not sufficiently evolved to form stars. I suggest a revision of the criteria used to identify "evolved" cores. Class 0 and class I protostars covered by my survey cannot be uniquely discriminated, suggesting also a revision of criteria used to assign infrared classes. Furthermore, I report the discovery of L1148-IRS, a candidate Very Low Luminosity Object (VeLLO; L &lt; 0.1 L_sun ) in the nearby (325 pc) L1148 dense core. The global spectral energy distribution, the morphology of nebulosity detected near 1 {\^I}¼m wavelength, the inferred density profile of the dense core, and the tentative detection of inward motions towards L1148-IRS are consistent with the source being an embedded protostar. It is unlikely that L1148-IRS is a galaxy by chance projected onto the L1148 dense core. I do, however, not detect hallmarks of active star formation like molecular outflows or clear bipolar nebulosity proving a protostellar nature of L1148-IRS. This is consistent with our present view of VeLLOs. If L1148-IRS is a VeLLO, then it is a very interesting one. Its present mass would be substellar, and its immediate envelope has a mass of only about 0.15 M_sun . Thus, L1148-IRS would be the first protostar to definitely have a significantly sub-solar final mass. The collapse of the natal dense core could not be understood in the framework of quasistatically evolving cores. This would make L1148 the first dense core in which non-quasistatic evolution plays a significant role. <P />},

@article{Palla:1990aa,
	Abstract = {The protostar mass-radius relation is combined with standard premain-sequence evolutionary tracks to construct the birthline for stars of intermediate mass. This theoretical birthline is in good agreement with the observed upper envelope of the distribution of Herbig Ae and Be stars in the H-R diagram. From the intersection of the birthline with the ZAMS, it is predicted that stars with more than 10 solar masses should never exhibit an optical premain-sequence phase; this prediction also agrees with existing observations. These findings show that stars of intermediate mass are first optically visible quite close to the main sequence. Hence, their contraction ages are less than the traditional ones derived assuming large initial radii. The birthline is also well delineated by the locus in the diagram of optically visible stars with associated molecular outflows. The underlying protostar theory predicts that newly formed stars of intermediate mass burn deuterium in a subsurface shell. An outer convection zone maintained by this shell burning is proposed to be the cause of the winds and surface activity commonly observed in these stars.},

	Abstract = {Although fundamental for astrophysics, the processes that produce massive stars are not well understood. Large distances, high extinction, and short timescales of critical evolutionary phases make observations of these processes challenging. Lacking good observational guidance, theoretical models have remained controversial. This review offers a basic description of the collapse of a massive molecular core and a critical discussion of the three competing concepts of massive star formation: <P />monolithic collapse in isolated cores <P />competitive accretion in a protocluster environment <P />stellar collisions and mergers in very dense systems <P />We also review the observed outflows, multiplicity, and clustering properties of massive stars, the upper initial mass function and the upper mass limit. We conclude that high-mass star formation is not merely a scaled-up version of low-mass star formation with higher accretion rates, but partly a mechanism of its own, primarily owing to the role of stellar mass and radiation pressure in controlling the dynamics.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of large numbers of young low-mass stars and brown dwarfs over the past decade has made it possible to investigate star formation and early evolution in a previously unexplored mass regime. In this review, we begin by describing surveys for low-mass members of nearby associations, open clusters, star-forming regions, and the methods used to characterize their stellar properties. We then use observations of these populations to test theories of star formation and evolution at low masses. For comparison to the formation models, we consider the initial mass function, stellar multiplicity, circumstellar disks, protostellar characteristics, and kinematic and spatial distributions at birth for low-mass stars and brown dwarfs. To test the evolutionary models, we focus on measurements of dynamical masses and empirical Hertzsprung-Russell diagrams for young brown dwarfs and planetary companions.},

	Abstract = {We present a continuing study of a sample 44 molecular outflows, observed in <SUP>13</SUP>CO lines, closely associated with 6.7-GHz methanol masers, hence called methanol maser associated outflows (MMAOs). We compare MMAO properties with those of outflows from other surveys in the literature. In general, MMAOs follow similar trends, but show a deficit in number at low masses and momenta, with a corresponding higher fraction at the high end of the distributions. A similar trend is seen for the dynamical time-scales of MMAOs. We argue that the lack of relatively low mass and young flows in MMAOs is due to the inherent selection-bias in the sample, i.e. its direct association with 6.7-GHz methanol masers. This implies that methanol masers must switch on after the onset of outflows (hence accretion), and not before a sufficient abundance of methanol is liberated from icy dust mantles. Consequently the average dynamical age of MMAOs is older than for the general population of molecular outflows. We propose an adjusted evolutionary sequence of outflow and maser occurrence in the hot core phase, where methanol masers turn on after the onset of the outflow phase.},

	Abstract = {<BR /> Aims: We investigate the molecular gas properties of the deeply obscured luminous infrared galaxy NGC 4418. We address the excitation of the complex molecule HC<SUB>3</SUB>N to determine whether its unusually luminous emission is related to the nature of the buried nuclear source. <BR /> Methods: We use IRAM 30 m and JCMT observations of rotational and vibrational lines of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N to model the excitation of the molecule by means of rotational diagrams. <BR /> Results: We report the first confirmed extragalactic detection of vibrational lines of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N. We detect 6 different rotational transitions ranging from J = 10-9 to J = 30-29 in the ground vibrational state and obtain a tentative detection of the J = 38-37 line. We also detect 7 rotational transitions of the vibrationally excited states v<SUB>6</SUB> and v<SUB>7</SUB>, with angular momenta ranging from J = 10-9 to 28-27. The energies of the upper states of the observed transitions range from 20 to 850 K. In the optically thin regime, we find that the rotational transitions of the vibrational ground state can be fitted for two temperatures, 30 K and 260 K, while the vibrationally excited levels can be fitted for a rotational temperature of 90 K and a vibrational temperature of 500 K. In the inner 300 pc of NGC 4418, we estimate a high HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundance, of the order of 10<SUP>-7</SUP>. <BR /> Conclusions: The excitation of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N molecule responds strongly to the intense radiation field and the presence of warm, dense gas and dust at the center of NGC 4418. The intense HC<SUB>3</SUB>N line emission is a result of both high abundances and excitation. The properties of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N emitting gas are similar to those found for hot cores in Sgr B2, which implies that the nucleus (&lt;300 pc) of NGC 4418 is reminiscent of a hot core. The potential presence of a compact, hot component (T = 500 K) is also discussed.},

The intensity distributions of these molecules are similar to each other at an angular resolution of 53″, corresponding to 0.19 pc, suggesting that these molecules trace the same dense cores. We identified 25 local peaks in the velocity-integrated intensity maps of the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N and/or N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP> emission. Assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium conditions, we calculated the column densities of these molecules and found a tendency for the N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>/HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundance ratio to be low in starless regions while it seems to be high in star-forming regions, similar to the tendencies in the NH<SUB>3</SUB>/CCS, NH<SUB>3</SUB>/HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>/CCS abundance ratios found in previous studies of dark clouds and the Orion A giant molecular cloud (GMC). We suggest that carbon chain molecules, including HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, may trace chemically young molecular gas, and that N-bearing molecules, such as N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>, may trace later stages of chemical evolution in the Vela C molecular clouds. It may be possible that the N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>/HC<SUB>3</SUB>N abundance ratio of ∼1.4 divides the star-forming and starless peaks in Vela C, although it is not as clear as those in NH<SUB>3</SUB>/CCS, NH<SUB>3</SUB>/HC<SUB>3</SUB>N, and N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>/CCS for the Orion A GMC. This less clear separation may be caused by our lower spatial resolution or the misclassification of star-forming and starless peaks due to the larger distance of Vela C. It might also be possible that the HC<SUB>3</SUB>N (J = 10-9) transition is not a good chemical evolution tracer compared with CCS (J = 4-3 and 7-6) transitions.},

	Abstract = {We investigated the chemical evolution of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N in six dense molecular clouds, using archival available data from the Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey (Hi-GAL) and the Millimeter Astronomy Legacy Team Survey at 90 GHz (MALT90). Radio sky surveys of the Multi-Array Galactic Plane Imaging Survey (MAGPIS) and the Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey (SUMSS) indicate these dense molecular clouds are associated with ultracompact H II (UCH II) regions and/or classical H II regions. We find that in dense molecular clouds associated with normal classical H II regions, the abundance of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N begins to decrease or reaches a plateau when the dust temperature gets hot. This implies UV photons could destroy the molecule of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N. On the other hand, in the other dense molecular clouds associated with UCH II regions, we find the abundance of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N increases with dust temperature monotonously, implying HC<SUB>3</SUB>N prefers to be formed in warm gas. We also find that the spectra of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N (10-9) in G12.804-0.199 and RCW 97 show wing emissions, and the abundance of HC<SUB>3</SUB>N in these two regions increases with its non-thermal velocity width, indicating HC<SUB>3</SUB>N might be a shock origin species. We further investigated the evolutionary trend of N(N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>)/N(HC<SUB>3</SUB>N) column density ratio, and found this ratio could be used as a chemical evolutionary indicator of cloud evolution after the massive star formation is started.},

	Abstract = {Spatially resolved kinematics of nearby galaxies has shown that the ratio of dynamical to stellar population-based estimates of the mass of a galaxy (M_ * ^JAM/M_ * ) correlates with σ<SUB>e</SUB>, the light-weighted velocity dispersion within its half-light radius, if M<SUB>*</SUB> is estimated using the same initial mass function (IMF) for all galaxies and the stellar mass-to-light ratio within each galaxy is constant. This correlation may indicate that, in fact, the IMF is more bottom-heavy or dwarf-rich for galaxies with large σ. We use this correlation to estimate a dynamical or IMF-corrected stellar mass, M_ * ^ α _ JAM  , from M<SUB>*</SUB> and σ<SUB>e</SUB> for a sample of 6 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) galaxies for which spatially resolved kinematics is not available. We also compute the `virial' mass estimate k(n,R) R_e σ _R^2/G, where n is the S{\'e}rsic index, in the SDSS and ATLAS<SUP>3D</SUP> samples. We show that an n-dependent correction must be applied to the k(n, R) values provided by Prugniel &amp; Simien. Our analysis also shows that the shape of the velocity dispersion profile in the ATLAS<SUP>3D</SUP> sample varies weakly with n: (σ<SUB>R</SUB>/σ<SUB>e</SUB>) = (R/R<SUB>e</SUB>)<SUP>-γ(n)</SUP>. The resulting stellar mass functions, based on M_*^ α _ JAM   and the recalibrated virial mass, are in good agreement. Using a Fundamental Plane-based observational proxy for σ<SUB>e</SUB> produces comparable results. The use of direct measurements for estimating the IMF-dependent stellar mass is prohibitively expensive for a large sample of galaxies. By demonstrating that cheaper proxies are sufficiently accurate, our analysis should enable a more reliable census of the mass in stars, especially at high redshift, at a fraction of the cost. Our results are provided in tabular form.},

	Abstract = {There is currently no accepted theoretical framework for the formation of the most massive stars, and the manner in which protostars continue to accrete and grow in mass beyond ∼10 M<SUB>☉</SUB> is still a controversial topic. In this study we use several prescriptions of stellar accretion and a description of the Galactic gas distribution to simulate the luminosities and spatial distribution of massive protostellar population of the Galaxy. We then compare the observables of each simulation to the results of the Red MSX Source (RMS) survey, a recently compiled data base of massive young stellar objects (YSO). We find that the observations are best matched by accretion rates which increase as the protostar grows in mass, such as those predicted by the turbulent core and competitive accretion (i.e. Bondi-Hoyle) models. These 'accelerating accretion' models provide very good qualitative and quantitative fits to the data, though we are unable to distinguish between these two models on our simulations alone. We rule out models with accretion rates which are constant with time, and those which are initially very high and which fall away with time, as these produce results which are quantitatively and/or qualitatively incompatible with the observations. To simultaneously match the low- and high-luminosity YSO distribution we require the inclusion of a 'swollen-star' pre-main-sequence phase, the length of which is well-described by the Kelvin-Helmholz time-scale. Our results suggest that the lifetime of the YSO phase is ∼10<SUP>5</SUP> yr, whereas the compact H II region phase lasts between ∼2 and 4 × 10<SUP>5</SUP> yr depending on the final mass of the star. Finally, the absolute numbers of YSOs are best matched by a globally averaged star formation rate for the Galaxy of 1.5-2 M<SUB>☉</SUB>.},

	Abstract = {We present a complete sample of molecular clumps containing compact and ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions between ℓ = 10$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ and |b| &lt; 1$\,^{\circ}$, identified by combining the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy submm and CORNISH radio continuum surveys with visual examination of archival infrared data. Our sample is complete to optically thin, compact and UC H II regions driven by a zero-age main-sequence star of spectral type B0 or earlier embedded within a 1000 M<SUB>☉</SUB> clump. In total we identify 213 compact and UC H II regions, associated with 170 clumps. Unambiguous kinematic distances are derived for these clumps and used to estimate their masses and physical sizes, as well as the Lyman continuum fluxes and sizes of their embedded H II regions. We find a clear lower envelope for the surface density of molecular clumps hosting massive star formation of 0.05 g cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, which is consistent with a similar sample of clumps associated with 6.7 GHz masers. The mass of the most massive embedded stars is closely correlated with the mass of their natal clump. Young B stars appear to be significantly more luminous in the ultraviolet than predicted by current stellar atmosphere models. The properties of clumps associated with compact and UC H II regions are very similar to those associated with 6.7 GHz methanol masers and we speculate that there is little evolution in the structure of the molecular clumps between these two phases. Finally, we identify a significant peak in the surface density of compact and UC H II-regions associated with the W49A star-forming complex, noting that this complex is truly one of the most massive and intense regions of star formation in the Galaxy.},

	Abstract = {Cold dark clouds are nearby members of the densest and coldest phase in the Galactic interstellar medium, and represent the most accessible sites where stars like our Sun are currently being born. In this review we discuss recent progress in their study, including the newly discovered IR dark clouds that are likely precursors to stellar clusters. At large scales, dark clouds present filamentary mass distributions with motions dominated by supersonic turbulence. At small, subparsec scales, a population of subsonic starless cores provides a unique glimpse of the conditions prior to stellar birth. Recent studies of starless cores reveal a combination of simple physical properties together with a complex chemical structure dominated by the freeze-out of molecules onto cold dust grains. Elucidating this combined structure is both an observational and theoretical challenge whose solution will bring us closer to understanding how molecular gas condenses to form stars.},

	Abstract = {Context: Gas within a galaxy is forced to establish pressure balance against gravitational forces. The shape of an unperturbed gaseous disk can be used to constrain dark matter models. <BR />Aims: We derive the 3D HI volume density distribution for the Milky Way out to a galactocentric radius of 40 kpc and a height of 20 kpc to constrain the Galactic mass distribution. <BR />Methods: We used the Leiden/Argentine/Bonn all sky 21-cm line survey. The transformation from brightness temperatures to densities depends on the rotation curve. We explored several models, reflecting different dark matter distributions. Each of these models was set up to solve the combined Poisson-Boltzmann equation in a self-consistent way and optimized to reproduce the observed flaring. <BR />Results: Besides a massive extended halo of M ∼ 1.8 × 10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, we find a self-gravitating dark matter disk with M=2 to 3 × 10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, including a dark matter ring at 13 &lt; R &lt; 18.5 kpc with M = 2.2 to 2.8 × 10<SUP>10</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. The existence of the ring was previously postulated from EGRET data and coincides with a giant stellar structure that surrounds the Galaxy. The resulting Milky Way rotation curve is flat up to R ∼ 27 kpc and slowly decreases outwards. The HI gas layer is strongly flaring. The HWHM scale height is 60 pc at R = 4 kpc and increases to ~2700 pc at R = 40 kpc. Spiral arms cause a noticeable imprint on the gravitational field, at least out to R = 30 kpc. <BR />Conclusions: Our mass model supports previous proposals that the giant stellar ring structure is due to a merging dwarf galaxy. The fact that the majority of the dark matter in the Milky Way for R ⪉ 40 kpc can be successfully modeled by a self-gravitating isothermal disk raises the question of whether this massive disk may have been caused by similar merger events in the past. The substructure in the Galactic dark matter disk suggests a dissipative nature for the dark matter disk.},

	Abstract = {Neutral atomic hydrogen (Hi) traces the interstellar medium (ISM) over a broad range of physical conditions. Its 21-cm emission line is a key probe of the structure and dynamics of the Milky Way Galaxy. About 50 years after the first detection of the 21-cm line the exploration of the Hi distribution of the Milky Way has undergone a true renaissance. This was triggered by several large-scale 21-cm surveys that became available within the past decade. New all-sky surveys unravel the shape and volume density distribution of the gaseous disk up to its borders. High-resolution Galactic plane surveys disclose a wealth of shells, filaments, and spurs that bear witness to the recycling of matter between stars and the ISM. All these observational results indicate that the Hi gas traces a dynamical Galactic ISM with structures on all scales, from tens of astronomical units to kiloparsecs. The Galaxy can be considered to be a violent, breathing disk surrounded by highly turbulent extra-planar gas.},

	Abstract = {Context. Recent submillimeter and far-infrared wavelength observations of absorption in the rotational ground-state lines of various simple molecules against distant Galactic continuum sources have opened the possibility of studying the chemistry of diffuse molecular clouds throughout the Milky Way. In order to calculate abundances, the column densities of molecular and atomic hydrogen, H I, must be known. <BR /> Aims: We aim at determining the atomic hydrogen column densities for diffuse clouds located on the sight lines toward a sample of prominent high-mass star-forming regions that were intensely studied with the HIFI instrument onboard Herschel. <BR /> Methods: Based on Jansky Very Large Array data, we employ the 21 cm H I absorption-line technique to construct profiles of the H I opacity versus radial velocity toward our target sources. These profiles are combined with lower resolution archival data of extended H I emission to calculate the H I column densities of the individual clouds along the sight lines. We employ Bayesian inference to estimate the uncertainties of the derived quantities. <BR /> Results: Our study delivers reliable estimates of the atomic hydrogen column density for a large number of diffuse molecular clouds at various Galactocentric distances. Together with column densities of molecular hydrogen derived from its surrogates observed with HIFI, the measurements can be used to characterize the clouds and investigate the dependence of their chemistry on the molecular fraction, for example. <P />The data sets are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (<A href="http://130.79.128.5">http://130.79.128.5</A>) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/600/A2">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/600/A2</A>},

	Abstract = {We present newly obtained three-dimensional gaseous maps of the Milky Way Galaxy: H I, H<SUB>2</SUB>, and total-gas (H I plus H<SUB>2</SUB>) maps, which were derived from the H I and <SUP>12</SUP>CO(J = 1-0) survey data and rotation curves based on the kinematic distance. The H I and H<SUB>2</SUB> face-on maps show that the H I disk is extended to a radius of 15-20 kpc and its outskirts are asymmetric to the Galactic center, while most of the H<SUB>2</SUB> gas is distributed inside the solar circle. The total gas mass within a radius of 30 kpc amounts to 8.0 × 10<SUP>9</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, 89% and 11% of which are H I and H<SUB>2</SUB>, respectively. The vertical slices show that the outer H I disk is strongly warped and the inner H I and H<SUB>2</SUB> disks are corrugated. The total gas map is advantageous for tracing spiral structures from the inner to outer disk. Spiral structures such as the Norma-Cygnus, the Perseus, the Sagittarius-Carina, the Scutum-Crux, and the Orion arms are more clearly traced in the total gas map than ever. All the spiral arms are well explained by logarithmic spiral arms with pitch angles of 11$\,^{\circ}$-15$\,^{\circ}$. The molecular fraction of the total gas is high near the Galactic center and decreases with Galactocentric distance. The molecular fraction is also locally enhanced at the spiral arms compared with the inter-arm regions.},

	Abstract = {<BR /> Aims: We estimate the mass of the inner (&lt; 20 kpc) Milky Way and the axis ratio of its inner dark matter halo using globular clusters as tracers. At the same time, we constrain the distribution in phase-space of the globular cluster system around the Galaxy. <BR /> Methods: We use the Gaia Data Release 2 catalogue of 75 globular clusters' proper motions and recent measurements of the proper motions of another 20 distant clusters obtained with the Hubble Space Telescope. We describe the globular cluster system with a distribution function (DF) with two components: a flat, rotating disc-like one and a rounder, more extended halo-like one. While fixing the Milky Way's disc and bulge, we let the mass and shape of the dark matter halo and we fit these two parameters, together with six others describing the DF, with a Bayesian method. <BR /> Results: We find the mass of the Galaxy within 20 kpc to be M(&lt;20 kpc) = 1.91<SUB>-0.17</SUB><SUP>+0.18</SUP>×10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>, of which M<SUB>DM</SUB>(&lt;20 kpc) = 1.37<SUB>-0.17</SUB><SUP>+0.18</SUP>×10<SUP>11</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB> is in dark matter, and the density axis ratio of the dark matter halo to be q = 1.30 $\pm$ 0.25. Assuming a concentration-mass relation, this implies a virial mass M<SUB>vir</SUB> = 1.3$\pm$0.3×10<SUP>12</SUP> M<SUB>☉</SUB>. Our analysis rules out oblate (q &lt; 0.8) and strongly prolate halos (q &gt; 1.9) with 99% probability. Our preferred model reproduces well the observed phase-space distribution of globular clusters and has a disc component that closely resembles that of the Galactic thick disc. The halo component follows a power-law density profile ρ ∝ r<SUP>-3.3</SUP>, has a mean rotational velocity of V<SUB>rot</SUB> ≃ -14km s<SUP>-1</SUP> at 20 kpc, and has a mildly radially biased velocity distribution (β ≃ 0.2 $\pm$ 0.07, which varies significantly with radius only within the inner 15 kpc). We also find that our distinction between disc and halo clusters resembles, although not fully, the observed distinction in metal-rich ([Fe/H] &gt; -0.8) and metal-poor ([Fe/H] ≤ -0.8) cluster populations.},

	Abstract = {We use the very large Millennium Simulation of the concordance Λ cold dark matter cosmogony to calibrate the bias and error distribution of Timing Argument estimators of the masses of the Local Group and of the Milky Way. From a large number of isolated spiral-spiral pairs similar to the Milky Way/Andromeda system, we find the interquartile range of the ratio of timing mass to true mass to be a factor of 1.8, while the 5 and 95 per cent points of the distribution of this ratio are separated by a factor of 5.7. Here, we define true mass as the sum of the `virial' masses, M<SUB>200</SUB>, of the two dominant galaxies. For present best values of the distance and approach velocity of Andromeda, this leads to a median likelihood estimate of the true mass of the Local Group of 5.27 × 10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> or logM<SUB>LG</SUB>/M<SUB>solar</SUB> = 12.72, with an interquartile range of [12.58, 12.83] and a 5-95 per cent range of [12.26, 13.01]. Thus, a 95 per cent lower confidence limit on the true mass of the Local Group is 1.81 × 10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>. A timing estimate of the Milky Way's mass based on the large recession velocity observed for the distant satellite Leo I works equally well, although with larger systematic uncertainties. It gives an estimated virial mass for the Milky Way of 2.43 × 10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB> with a 95 per cent lower confidence limit of 0.80 × 10<SUP>12</SUP>M<SUB>solar</SUB>.},

	Abstract = {We present a method for determining the Galactic mass and mass distribution based on maximum likelihood parameter estimation. We show that the number density of the Galaxy's outer satellites can be modelled by a power-law function. Assuming that the total distribution of matter (visible and dark) can be modelled in a similar way, we construct a self- consistent, self-similar model of the outer Galaxy. From this we derive a probability distribution for two quantities; the radial velocity and galactocentric distance. Considering the velocity distribution in the outer Galaxy to be isotropic, this probability distribution contains two free parameters; the Galactic mass and the power-law index for the total matter density profile which we subsequently determine by way of maximum likelihood estimation. We obtain a mass of around 1.3 X 10^12^ M_sun_ out to a distance of 230 kpc from the Galactic Centre with a corresponding power-law index of 2.4. Confidence regions are derived for these estimates from which a `low-mass' galaxy, (i.e. M &lt; 6 X 10^11^ M_sun_), can be ruled out with 98 per cent confidence. Our result suggests a high mass for the Milky Way out to a large distance and relies on the inclusion of the dwarf spheroidal galaxy Leo I in the sample. The most recent velocity and distance data we could find for all globular clusters and dwarf spheroidal galaxies, beyond R_0_, including the newly discovered dwarf spheroidal galaxy in Sextans were used in the analysis. We also briefly discuss a self-similar galactic model where the velocity distribution is anisotropic.},

	Abstract = {We report Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) observations of 243-263 GHz absorption lines from Galactic diffuse molecular gas seen against three extragalactic radio-loud objects, J1717-337, J1625-254, and NRAO530. No significant absorption features were detected in our new sensitive ALMA Band 6 (λ ≃ 1.2 mm) spectra (1σ ≃ 2-4 mJy beam<SUP>-1</SUP> with a velocity resolution of 1 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>), despite the fact that the obtained spectra cover the line frequencies of c-C<SUB>3</SUB>H<SUB>2</SUB>, CS, H<SUP>13</SUP>CN, HCO, H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP>, SiO, and C<SUB>2</SUB>H, and that the lower transition absorption lines of these molecular species have been detected in ALMA Band 3 (λ ≃ 3 mm) observations toward these three Galactic molecular absorption systems. By combining the upper limits of the higher transitions that we obtain in this study and the archival detections of the lower transitions, we constrain the excitation temperatures of these species in the Galactic diffuse medium to be below 10 K, in spite of their PDR-like chemical states, where elevated column density ratios of HCO to H<SUP>13</SUP>CO<SUP>+</SUP> are previously reported. These constraints are in line with the widely accepted view of the diffuse molecular clouds, where the molecular excitation is almost in equilibrium with the cosmic microwave background, although its kinetic temperature can be a few tens of Kelvin. Molecular abundance patterns seem to be similar in the Galactic diffuse gas and nearby active galaxies observed with a kpc-scale beam, suggesting the importance of observations with a parsec-scale resolution, which can resolve individual molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {Much of the interstellar medium in disk galaxies is in the form of neutral atomic hydrogen, H I. This gas can be in thermal equilibrium at relatively low temperatures, T&lt;~300 K (the cold neutral medium [CNM]), or at temperatures somewhat less than 10<SUP>4</SUP> K (the warm neutral medium [WNM]). These two phases can coexist over a narrow range of pressures, P<SUB>min</SUB>&lt;=P&lt;=P<SUB>max</SUB>. We determine P<SUB>min</SUB> and P<SUB>max</SUB> in the plane of the Galaxy as a function of Galactocentric radius R using recent determinations of the gas heating rate and the gas-phase abundances of interstellar gas. We provide an analytic approximation for P<SUB>min</SUB> as a function of metallicity, far-ultraviolet radiation field, and the ionization rate of atomic hydrogen. Our analytic results show that the existence of P<SUB>min</SUB>, or the possibility of a two-phase equilibrium, generally requires that H<SUP>+</SUP> exceed C<SUP>+</SUP> in abundance at P<SUB>min</SUB>. The abundance of H<SUP>+</SUP> is set by EUV/soft X-ray photoionization and by recombination with negatively charged polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons. In order to assess whether thermal or pressure equilibrium is a realistic assumption, we define a parameter Υ≡t<SUB>cool</SUB>/t<SUB>shock</SUB>, where t<SUB>cool</SUB> is the gas cooling time and t<SUB>shock</SUB> is the characteristic shock time or ``time between shocks in a turbulent medium.'' For Υ&lt;1 gas has time to reach thermal balance between supernova-induced shocks. We find that this condition is satisfied in the Galactic disk, and thus the two-phase description of the interstellar H I is approximately valid even in the presence of interstellar turbulence. Observationally, the mean density HI&gt; is often better determined than the local density, and we cast our results in terms of HI&gt; as well. Over most of the disk of the Galaxy, the H I must be in two phases: the weight of the H I in the gravitational potential of the Galaxy is large enough to generate thermal pressures exceeding P<SUB>min</SUB>, so that turbulent pressure fluctuations can produce cold gas that is thermally stable; and the mean density of the H I is too low for the gas to be all CNM. Our models predict the presence of CNM gas to R~=16-18 kpc, somewhat farther than previous estimates. An estimate for the typical thermal pressure in the Galactic plane for 3kpc&lt;~R&lt;~18 kpc is P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=1.4×10<SUP>4</SUP>exp(-R/5.5kpc) K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. At the solar circle, this gives P<SUB>th</SUB>/k~=3000 K cm<SUP>-3</SUP>. We show that this pressure is consistent with the C I*/C I<SUB>tot</SUB> ratio observed by Jenkins &amp; Tripp and the CNM temperature found by Heiles &amp; Troland. We also examine the potential impact of turbulent heating on our results and provide parameterized expressions for the heating rate as a function of Galactic radius. Although the uncertainties are large, our models predict that including turbulent heating does not significantly change our results and that thermal pressures remain above P<SUB>min</SUB> to R~=18 kpc.},

	Abstract = {We report on observations of several optical emission lines toward a variety of newly revealed faint, large-scale Hα-emitting regions in the Galaxy. The lines include [N II] λ6583, [N II] λ5755, [S II] λ6716, [O III] λ5007, and He I λ5876 obtained with the Wisconsin Hα Mapper (WHAM) toward sight lines that probe superbubbles, high-latitude filamentary features, and the more diffuse warm ionized medium (WIM). Our observations include maps covering thousands of square degrees toward the well-known Orion-Eridanus bubble, a recently discovered 60<SUP>deg</SUP>×20<SUP>deg</SUP> bipolar superbubble centered in Perseus, plus several classical H II regions surrounding OB stars and hot evolved stellar cores. We use the emission-line data to explore the temperature and ionization conditions within the emitting gas and their variations between the different emission regions. We find that in the diffuse WIM and in the faint high-latitude filamentary structures the line ratios of [N II]/Hα and [S II]/Hα are generally high, while [O III]/Hα and He I/Hα are generally low compared to the bright classical H II regions. This suggests that the gas producing this faint widespread emission is warmer, in a lower ionization state, and ionized by a softer spectrum than gas in classical H II regions surrounding O stars, the presumed ionization source for the WIM. In addition, we find differences in physical conditions between the large bubble structures and the more diffuse WIM, suggesting that the ionization of superbubble walls by radiation from interior O associations does not account entirely for the range of conditions found within the WIM, particularly the highest values of [N II]/Hα and [S II]/Hα.},

	Abstract = {We report high-spectral-resolution Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) HI 21-cm observations resulting in the detection of the warm neutral medium (WNM) of the Galaxy in absorption against two extragalactic radio sources, PKS 1814-637 and PKS 0407-658. The two lines of sight were selected on the basis of the simplicity of their absorption profiles and the strength of the background sources; the high velocity resolution of the spectra then enabled us to estimate the kinetic temperatures of the absorbing gas by fitting multiple Gaussians to the absorption profiles. Four separate WNM components were detected towards the two sources, with peak optical depths τ<SUB>max</SUB>= (1.0 +/- 0.08) × 10<SUP>-2</SUP>, (1.4 +/- 0.2) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP>, (2.2 +/- 0.5) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and (3.4 +/- 0.5) × 10<SUP>-3</SUP> and kinetic temperatures T<SUB>k</SUB>= 3127 +/- 300, 3694 +/- 1595, 3500 +/- 1354 and 2165 +/- 608 K, respectively.

	Abstract = {In this chapter we describe how elements have been and are still being formed in the galaxy and how they are transformed into the reservoir of materials present in protostellar environments. We discuss the global cycle of matter from stars, where nucleosynthesis produces heavy elements that are ejected through explosions and winds into the interstellar medium (ISM), through the formation and evolution of interstellar cloud material. In diffuse clouds, low-energy cosmic rays impact silicate grains, amorphizing crystals, and UV photons easily penetrate, sponsoring a simple photochemistry. In dense cold molecular clouds, cosmic rays penetrate, driving a chemistry where neutral-neutral reactions and ion-molecule reactions increase the complexity of molecules in icy grain mantles. In the coldest, densest prestellar cores within molecular clouds, all available heavy elements are depleted onto grains. Dense cores collapse to form protostars and the protostars heat the surrounding infalling matter and release molecules previously frozen in ices into the gas phase, sponsoring a rich gas-phase chemistry. Some material from the cold regions and from hot or warm cores within molecular clouds probably survives to be incorporated into the protoplanetary disks as interstellar matter. For diffuse clouds, for molecular clouds, and for dense hot cores and dense warm cores, the physiochemical processes that occur within the gas and solid state materials are discussed in detail. <P />},

	Abstract = {Aims:We study a sample composed of 28 of the brightest stars in the Arches cluster. Our aim is to constrain their stellar and wind properties and to establish their nature and evolutionary status. <BR />Methods: We analyze K-band spectra obtained with the integral field spectrograph SINFONI on the VLT. Atmosphere models computed with the code CMFGEN are used to derive the effective temperatures, luminosities, stellar abundances, mass loss rates and wind terminal velocities. <BR />Results: We find that the stars in our sample are either H-rich WN7-9 stars (WN7-9h) or supergiants, where two are classified as OIf<SUP>+</SUP>. All stars are 2-4 Myr old. There is marginal evidence for a younger age among the most massive stars. The WN7-9h stars reach luminosities as high as 2 × 10<SUP>6</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>, consistent with initial masses of ~120 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. They are still quite H-rich, but show both N enhancement and C depletion. They are thus identified as core H-burning objects showing products of the CNO equilibrium on their surface. Their progenitors are most likely supergiants of spectral types earlier than O4-6 and initial masses &gt;60 M<SUB>☉</SUB>. Their winds follow a well-defined modified wind momentum - luminosity relation (WLR): this is a strong indication that they are radiatively driven. Stellar abundances tend to favor a slightly super-solar metallicity, at least for the lightest metals. We note, however, that the evolutionary models seem to under-predict the degree of N enrichment. <P />Based on observations collected at the ESO Very Large Telescope (program 075.D-0736(A)).

	Abstract = {This review examines the state-of-the-art knowledge of high-mass star and massive cluster formation, gained from ambitious observational surveys, which acknowledges the multiscale characteristics of these processes. After a brief overview of theoretical models and main open issues, we present observational searches for the evolutionary phases of high-mass star formation, first among high-luminosity sources and more recently among young massive protostars and the elusive high-mass prestellar cores. We then introduce the most likely evolutionary scenario for high-mass star formation, which emphasizes the link of high-mass star formation to massive cloud and cluster formation. Finally, we introduce the first attempts to search for variations of the star-formation activity and cluster formation in molecular cloud complexes in the most extreme star-forming sites and across the Milky Way. The combination of Galactic plane surveys and high-angular resolution images with submillimeter facilities such as Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) are prerequisites to make significant progress in the forthcoming decade. <P />},

	Abstract = {Detailed observations of the nearest star-forming regions in the Milky Way (MW) provide the ultimate benchmark for studying star formation. The extent to which the results of these Galaxy-based studies can be extrapolated to extragalactic systems depends on the overlap of the environmental conditions probed. In this paper, we compare the properties of clouds and star-forming regions in the MW with those in nearby galaxies and in the high-redshift Universe. We find that in terms of their baryonic composition, kinematics and densities, the clouds in the solar neighbourhood are similar to those in nearby galaxies. The clouds and regions in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the inner 250 pc) of the MW are indistinguishable from high-redshift clouds and galaxies. The presently low star formation rate in the CMZ therefore implies that either (1) its gas represents the initial conditions for high-redshift starbursts or (2) some yet unidentified process consistently suppresses star formation over ≳ 10<SUP>8</SUP> yr time-scales. We conclude that the MW contains large reservoirs of gas with properties directly comparable to most of the known range of star formation environments and is therefore an excellent template for studying star formation across cosmological time-scales.},

With these new calibrations and the stellar atmosphere models of Kurucz, we calculate the physical parameters and ionizing photon luminosities in the H<SUB>0</SUB> and He<SUB>0</SUB> continua for O and early B-type stars. We find substantial differences between our values of the Lyman- continuum luminosity and those reported in the literature. We also discuss the systematic discrepancy between O-type stellar masses derived from spectroscopic models and those derived from evolutionary tracks. Most likely, the cause of this "mass discrepancy" lies primarily in the atmospheric models, which are plane parallel and hydrostatic and therefore do not account for an extended atmosphere and the velocity fields in a stellar wind. Finally, we present a new computation of the Lyman-continuum luminosity from 429 known O stars located within 2.5 kpc of the Sun. We find the total ionizing luminosity from this population (Q<SUB>0</SUB><SUP>Tot</SUP> = 7.0 × 10<SUP>51</SUP> photons s<SUP>-1</SUP>) to be 47% larger than that determined using the Lyman continuum values tabulated by Panagia.},

	Abstract = {We study the production of SiO in the gas phase of molecular outflows, through the sputtering of Si-bearing material in refractory grain cores, which are taken to be olivine. We calculate also the rotational line spectrum of the SiO. The sputtering is driven by neutral particle impact on charged grains, in steady-state C-type shock waves, at the speed of ambipolar diffusion. The emission of the SiO molecule is calculated by means of an LVG code. A grid of models, with shock speeds in the range 20 &lt; v<SUB>s</SUB> &lt; 50 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> and preshock gas densities 10<SUP>4</SUP> &lt; n<SUB>H</SUB> &lt; 10<SUP>6</SUP> cm<SUP>-3</SUP>, has been generated. We compare our results with those of an earlier study (Schilke et al. 1997). Improvements in the treatment of the coupling between the charged grains and the neutral fluid lead to narrower shock waves and lower fractions of Si (⪉10%) being released into the gas phase. Erosion of grain cores is significant (⪆1%) only for C-type shock speeds v<SUB>s</SUB> &gt; 25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP>, given the adopted properties of olivine. More realistic assumptions concerning the initial fractional abundance of O2 lead to SiO formation being delayed, so that it occurs in the cool, dense postshock flow. Good agreement is obtained with recent observations of SiO line intensities in the L1157 and L1448 molecular outflows. The inferred temperature, opacity, and SiO column density in the emission region differ significantly from those estimated by means of LVG ``slab'' models. The fractional abundance of SiO is deduced and found to be in the range 4 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> ⪉ n(SiO)/n<SUB>H</SUB> ⪉ 3 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP>. Observed line profiles are wider than predicted and imply multiple, unresolved shock regions within the beam.},

Numerical models are presented for typical parameters: n(H2) = 20/cu cm, n(H) = 10/cu cm, and v(s) = 10 km/s. C-type shock structure is weakly dependent on the angle (theta) between the upstream magnetic field B0 and the direction of shock propagation. For typical field strengths there is a critical angle below which the neutral flow must have at least one critical point (implying that the shock must be either transonic C-type or J-type), although in general this angle need not exist. Models differing only in the component of B0 parallel to the direction of shock propagation (i.e., having identical transverse components of B0) can have markedly different hydrodynamic structures. The column densities of most shock-produced species vary only mildly with theta between 90 and 40 deg when either B0 or B0 sin theta are held constant.},

@article{Klessen:2000aa,
	Abstract = {Turbulence is essential for understanding the structure and dynamics of molecular clouds and star-forming regions. There is a need for adequate tools to describe and characterize the properties of turbulent flows. One-point probability distribution functions (PDFs) of dynamical variables have been suggested as appropriate statistical measures and applied to several observed molecular clouds. However, the interpretation of these data requires comparison with numerical simulations. To address this issue, smoothed particle hydrodynamics (SPH) simulations of driven and decaying, supersonic, turbulent flows with and without self-gravity are presented. In addition, random Gaussian velocity fields are analyzed to estimate the influence of variance effects. To characterize the flow properties, the PDFs of the density, of the line-of-sight velocity centroids, and of the line centroid increments are studied. This is supplemented by a discussion of the dispersion and the kurtosis of the increment PDFs, as well as the spatial distribution of velocity increments for small spatial lags. From the comparison between different models of interstellar turbulence, it follows that the inclusion of self-gravity leads to better agreement with the observed PDFs in molecular clouds. The increment PDFs for small spatial lags become exponential for all considered velocities. However, all the processes considered here lead to non-Gaussian signatures, differences are only gradual, and the analyzed PDFs are in addition projection dependent. It appears therefore very difficult to distinguish between different physical processes on the basis of PDFs only, which limits their applicability for adequately characterizing interstellar turbulence.},

@article{Schneider:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Column-density maps of molecular clouds are one of the most important observables in the context of molecular cloud- and star-formation (SF) studies. With the Herschel satellite it is now possible to precisely determine the column density from dust emission, which is the best tracer of the bulk of material in molecular clouds. However, line-of-sight (LOS) contamination from fore- or background clouds can lead to overestimating the dust emission of molecular clouds, in particular for distant clouds. This implies values that are too high for column density and mass, which can potentially lead to an incorrect physical interpretation of the column density probability distribution function (PDF). In this paper, we use observations and simulations to demonstrate how LOS contamination affects the PDF. We apply a first-order approximation (removing a constant level) to the molecular clouds of Auriga and Maddalena (low-mass star-forming), and Carina and NGC 3603 (both high-mass SF regions). In perfect agreement with the simulations, we find that the PDFs become broader, the peak shifts to lower column densities, and the power-law tail of the PDF for higher column densities flattens after correction. All corrected PDFs have a lognormal part for low column densities with a peak at A<SUB>v</SUB> ~ 2 mag, a deviation point (DP) from the lognormal at A<SUB>v</SUB>(DP) ~ 4-5 mag, and a power-law tail for higher column densities. Assuming an equivalent spherical density distribution ρ ∝ r<SUP>- α</SUP>, the slopes of the power-law tails correspond to α<SUB>PDF</SUB> = 1.8, 1.75, and 2.5 for Auriga, Carina, and NGC 3603. These numbers agree within the uncertainties with the values of α ≈ 1.5,1.8, and 2.5 determined from the slope γ (with α = 1-γ) obtained from the radial column density profiles (N ∝ r<SUP>γ</SUP>). While α ~ 1.5-2 is consistent with a structure dominated by collapse (local free-fall collapse of individual cores and clumps and global collapse), the higher value of α &gt; 2 for NGC 3603 requires a physical process that leads to additional compression (e.g., expanding ionization fronts). From the small sample of our study, we find that clouds forming only low-mass stars and those also forming high-mass stars have slightly different values for their average column density (1.8 × 10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> vs. 3.0 × 10<SUP>21</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>), and they display differences in the overall column density structure. Massive clouds assemble more gas in smaller cloud volumes than low-mass SF ones. However, for both cloud types, the transition of the PDF from lognormal shape into power-law tail is found at the same column density (at A<SUB>v</SUB> ~ 4-5 mag). Low-mass and high-mass SF clouds then have the same low column density distribution, most likely dominated by supersonic turbulence. At higher column densities, collapse and external pressure can form the power-law tail. The relative importance of the twoprocesses can vary between clouds and thus lead to the observed differences in PDF and column density structure. <P />Appendices are available in electronic form at <A href="http://www.aanda.org/10.1051/0004-6361/201423569/olm">http://www.aanda.org</A>Herschel maps as FITS files are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/575/A79">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/575/A79</A>},

@article{Kroupa:2001aa,
	Abstract = {A universal initial mass function (IMF) is not intuitive, but so far no convincing evidence for a variable IMF exists. The detection of systematic variations of the IMF with star-forming conditions would be the Rosetta Stone for star formation. In this contribution an average or Galactic-field IMF is defined, stressing that there is evidence for a change in the power-law index at only two masses: near 0.5M<SUB>solar</SUB> and near 0.08M<SUB>solar</SUB>. Using this supposed universal IMF, the uncertainty inherent in any observational estimate of the IMF is investigated by studying the scatter introduced by Poisson noise and the dynamical evolution of star clusters. It is found that this apparent scatter reproduces quite well the observed scatter in power-law index determinations, thus defining the fundamental limit within which any true variation becomes undetectable. The absence of evidence for a variable IMF means that any true variation of the IMF in well-studied populations must be smaller than this scatter. Determinations of the power-law indices α are subject to systematic errors arising mostly from unresolved binaries. The systematic bias is quantified here, with the result that the single-star IMFs for young star clusters are systematically steeper by ∆α~0.5 between 0.1 and 1M<SUB>solar</SUB> than the Galactic-field IMF, which is populated by, on average, about 5-Gyr-old stars. The MFs in globular clusters appear to be, on average, systematically flatter than the Galactic-field IMF (Piotto &amp; Zoccali; Paresce &amp; De Marchi), and the recent detection of ancient white-dwarf candidates in the Galactic halo and the absence of associated low-mass stars (Ibata et al.; M{\'e}ndez &amp; Minniti) suggest a radically different IMF for this ancient population. Star formation in higher metallicity environments thus appears to produce relatively more low-mass stars. While still tentative, this is an interesting trend, being consistent with a systematic variation of the IMF as expected from theoretical arguments.},

	Abstract = {Context. Probability distribution functions (PDFs) of column densities are an established tool to characterize the evolutionary state of interstellar clouds. <BR /> Aims: Using simulations, we show to what degree their determination is affected by noise, line-of-sight contamination, field selection, and the incomplete sampling in interferometric measurements. <BR /> Methods: We solve the integrals that describe the convolution of a cloud PDF with contaminating sources such as noise and line-of-sight emission, and study the impact of missing information on the measured column density PDF. In this way we can quantify the effect of the different processes and propose ways to correct for their impact to recover the intrinsic PDF of the observed cloud. <BR /> Results: The effect of observational noise can be easily estimated and corrected for if the root mean square (rms) of the noise is known. For σ<SUB>noise</SUB> values below 40% of the typical cloud column density, N<SUB>peak</SUB>, this involves almost no degradation in the accuracy of the PDF parameters. For higher noise levels and narrow cloud PDFs the width of the PDF becomes increasingly uncertain. A contamination by turbulent foreground or background clouds can be removed as a constant shield if the peak of the contamination PDF falls at a lower column or is narrower than that of the observed cloud. Uncertainties in cloud boundary definition mainly affect the low-column density part of the PDF and the mean density. As long as more than 50% of a cloud is covered, the impact on the PDF parameters is negligible. In contrast, the incomplete sampling of the uv-plane in interferometric observations leads to uncorrectable PDF distortions in the maps produced. An extension of the capabilities of the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) would allow us to recover the high-column density tail of the PDF, but we found no way to measure the intermediate- and low-column density part of the underlying cloud PDF in interferometric observations.},

	Abstract = {Young massive stars produce sufficient Lyman continuum photon luminosity Phi<SUB>i</SUB> to significantly affect the structure and evolution of the accretion disks surrounding them. A nearly static, ionized, isothermal 10<SUP>4</SUP> K atmosphere forms above the neutral disk for disk radii r less than r<SUB>g</SUB> = 10<SUP>15</SUP> M<SUB>1</SUB> cm, where M<SUB>*</SUB> = 10 solar mass M<SUB>1</SUB> is the stellar mass. For r approximately greater than r<SUB>g</SUB> the diffuse field created by hydrogen recombinations to the ground state in the photoionized gas above the disk produces a steady evaporation at the surface of the disk, and this H II gas flows freely out to the ISM (the 'disk wind'). The detailed structure depends on the mass-loss rate dot-M<SUB>w</SUB> of the fast, approximately greater than 1000 km/sec, stellar wind from the massive star. A critical mass-loss rate dot-M<SUB>cr</SUB> is defined such that the ram pressure of the stellar wind equals the thermal pressure of the H II atmosphere at r<SUB>g</SUB>. In the weak stellar wind solution, dot-M<SUB>w</SUB> less than dot-M<SUB>cr</SUB>, the diffuse photons from the atmosphere above r<SUB>g</SUB> produce a photoevaporative mass-loss rate from the disk at r approximately greater than r<SUB>g</SUB> of order 1 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>(Phi<SUB>49</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP>(M<SUB>1</SUB>)<SUP>1/2</SUP> solar mass/year, where Phi<SUB>i</SUB> = 10<SUP>49</SUP> Phi<SUB>49</SUB>/sec. The resulting slow (10 to 50 km/sec) ionized outflow, which persists for approximately greater than 10<SUP>5</SUP> year for disk masses M<SUB>d</SUB> approximately 0.3 M<SUB>*</SUB>, may explain the observational characteri stics of unresolved, ultracompact H II regions. In the strong stellar wind solution, dot-M<SUB>w</SUB> greater than dot-M<SUB>cr</SUB>, the ram pressure of the stellar wind blows down the atmosphere for r less than r<SUB>g</SUB> and allows the stellar photons to penetrate to greater radii and smaller heights. A slow, ionized outflow produced mainly by diffuse photons is again created for r less than r<SUB>g</SUB>; however, it is now dominated by the flow at r<SUB>w</SUB>(greater than r<SUB>g</SUB>), the radius at which the stellar wind ram pressure equals the thermal pressure in the evaporating flow. The mass-loss rate from the disk is of order 6 x 10<SUP>-5</SUP>dot-M<SUB>w-6</SUB> v<SUB>w8</SUB>(Phi <SUB>49</SUB>)<SUP>-1/2</SUP> solar mass/year, where dot-M<SUB>w-6</SUB> = M<SUB>w</SUB>/10<SUP>-6</SUP> solar mass/year and v<SUB>w8</SUB> = v<SUB>w</SUB>/1000 km/sec is the stellar wind velocity. The resulting outflow, which also persists for approximately greater than 10<SUP>5</SUP> year may explain many of the more extended (r approximately greater than 10<SUP>16</SUP> cm) ultracompact H II regions. Both the weak-wind and the strong-wind models depend entirely on stellar parameters Phi<SUB>i</SUB>, M<SUB>*</SUB>, dot-M<SUB>w</SUB>) and are independent of disk parameters as long as an extended r much greater than (r<SUB>g</SUB>), neutral disk exists. We compare both weak-wind and strong-wind model results to the observed radio free-free spectra and luminosities of ultracompact H II regions and to the interesting source MWC 349.},

Although the black hole is essentially quiescent in the broader context of active galactic nuclei, X-ray observations have provided evidence for energetic outbursts from its surroundings<SUP>2</SUP>. Also, although the levels of star formation in the Galactic Centre have been approximately constant over the past few hundred million years, there is evidence of increased short-duration bursts<SUP>3</SUP>, strongly influenced by the interaction of the black hole with the enhanced gas density present within the ring-like central molecular zone<SUP>4</SUP> at Galactic longitude |l| &lt; 0.7 degrees and latitude |b| &lt; 0.2 degrees.

Here we report radio imaging that reveals a bipolar bubble structure, with an overall span of 1 degree by 3 degrees (140 parsecs × 430 parsecs), extending above and below the Galactic plane and apparently associated with the Galactic Centre. The structure is edge-brightened and bounded, with symmetry implying creation by an energetic event in the Galactic Centre. We estimate the age of the bubbles to be a few million years, with a total energy of 7 × 10<SUP>52</SUP> ergs. We postulate that the progenitor event was a major contributor to the increased cosmic-ray density in the Galactic Centre, and is in turn the principal source of the relativistic particles required to power the synchrotron emission of the radio filaments within and in the vicinity of the bubble cavities.},

	Abstract = {Within ten nearby (d &lt; 450 pc) Gould belt molecular clouds we evaluate statistically the relative orientation between the magnetic field projected on the plane of sky, inferred from the polarized thermal emission of Galactic dust observed by Planck at 353 GHz, and the gas column density structures, quantified by the gradient of the column density, N<SUB>H</SUB>. The selected regions, covering several degrees in size, are analysed at an effective angular resolution of 10' FWHM, thus sampling physical scales from 0.4 to 40 pc in the nearest cloud. The column densities in the selected regions range from N<SUB>H</SUB>≈ 10<SUP>21</SUP> to10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>, and hence they correspond to the bulk of the molecular clouds. The relative orientation is evaluated pixel by pixel and analysed in bins of column density using the novel statistical tool called "histogram of relative orientations". Throughout this study, we assume that the polarized emission observed by Planck at 353 GHz is representative of the projected morphology of the magnetic field in each region, I.e., we assume a constant dust grain alignment efficiency, independent of the local environment. Within most clouds we find that the relative orientation changes progressively with increasing N<SUB>H</SUB>, from mostly parallel or having no preferred orientation to mostly perpendicular. In simulations of magnetohydrodynamic turbulence in molecular clouds this trend in relative orientation is a signature of Alfv{\'e}nic or sub-Alfv{\'e}nic turbulence, implying that the magnetic field is significant for the gas dynamics at the scales probed by Planck. We compare the deduced magnetic field strength with estimates we obtain from other methods and discuss the implications of the Planck observations for the general picture of molecular cloud formation and evolution.},

	Abstract = {The study reports VL radio continuum and H110-alpha radio recombination line observations of Sgr B2 (G0.7-0.0) with spatial resolutions ranging from 3 to 20 arcsec. The extended component of Sgr B2 is imaged; the flux density of this component accounts for about 50 percent of the total flux density of the region at 20 cm. The discovery of several shell-like and cometary H II regions is reported. Physical parameters such as emission measures and electron densities are derived. The kinematics of the ionized gas is investigated. It is shown that the kinematics of the gas in Sgr B2 are complex. Although most of the ionized gas has velocities in the range 50-70 km/s, there is also some gas at velocities of about 100 km/s. The electron temperatures of sources in Sgr B2 range from 4700 to about 10,000 K.},

	Abstract = {Results are reported of a subarcsecond spatial resolution RF line and continuum study of the Sgr B2 region, observed at the frequency of the 76-alpha hydrogen recombination line and at the (J,K = 3,2) transition of NH3. Also reported are new observations of the ground-state OH main line masers toward Sgr B2 in both left and right circular polarization. The continuum images showed no less than 19 separate H II regions in the Sgr B2 complex. Ammonia emission was observed in the Sgr B2 K and F regions. The emission toward K was found near the K1, K2, and K3 regions. The NH3 emission and absorption toward the F region, along with the OH maser emission, delineate a rotating disk or torus of molecular material surrounding the Sgr B2 F complex of H II regions. The mass interior to the NH3 and OH emission regions was calculated to be on the order of 1400 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {We have observed the H93(alpha) radio recombination line emission toward the cometary H II region G34.3+0.2 component C. A velocity gradient with a total extent of approximately equal 35 km/s is found in the H93(alpha) line emission perpendicular to the symmetry axis of the cometary H II region. A smaller velocity gradient is found parallel to the symmetry axis. The moving star bow shock model and the champagne outflow model have been suggested to explain observations of G34.3+0.2C. Neither model adequately matches the available velocity data. G34.3+0.2 components A and B are found near G34.3+0.2C. The continuum spectral indices of components A and B are consistent with that expected for an ionized wind outflow. We suggest a qualitative model for the region where the ionizing star of the cometary H II region G34.3+0.2C photo-evaporates material from a hot ultracompact molecular core found just to the east of the continuum emission. Interaction between the ionized gas of the cometary H II region and winds from components A and B may explain many of the current observations. We have also mapped the 6<SUB>16</SUB> goes to 5<SUB>23</SUB> transition of H2O toward G34.3+0.2. We find strong H2O maser emission within a approximately equals 50 sec x 30 sec region. Some of the H2O masers are projected onto sources of radio continuum emission, but others are found well separated from radio continuum emission.},

	Abstract = {<BR /> Aims: Massive stars form in clusters, and their influence on nearby starless cores is still poorly understood. The protocluster associated with IRAS 22134+5834 represents an excellent laboratory for studying the influence of massive YSOs on nearby starless cores and the possible implications in the clustered star formation process. <BR /> Methods: IRAS 22134+5834 was observed in the cm range with (E)VLA, 3 mm with CARMA, 2 mm with PdBI, and 1.3 mm with SMA, to study both the continuum emission and the molecular lines that trace different physical conditions of the gas. <BR /> Results: The multiwavelength centimeter continuum observations revealed two radio sources within the cluster, VLA1 and VLA2. VLA1 is considered to be an optically thin UCHii region with a size of 0.01 pc that sits at the edge of the near-infrared (NIR) cluster. The flux of ionizing photons of the VLA1 corresponds to a B1 ZAMS star. VLA2 is associated with an infrared point source and has a negative spectral index. We resolved six millimeter continuum cores at 2 mm, MM2 is associated with the UCHii region VLA1, and other dense cores are distributed around the UCHii region. Two high-mass starless clumps (HMSC), HMSC-E (east) and HMSC-W (west), are detected around the NIR cluster with N<SUB>2</SUB>H<SUP>+</SUP>(1-0) and NH<SUB>3</SUB> emission, and they show different physical and chemical properties. Two N<SUB>2</SUB>D<SUP>+</SUP> cores are detected on an NH<SUB>3</SUB> filament close to the UCHii region with a projected separation of ~8000 AU at the assumed distance of 2.6 kpc. The kinematic properties of the molecular line emission confirm that the UCHii region is expanding and that the molecular cloud around the NIR cluster is also expanding. <BR /> Conclusions: Our multiwavelength study has revealed different generations of star formation in IRAS 22134+5834. The formed intermediate-to-massive stars show a strong impact on nearby starless clumps. We propose that the starless clumps and HMPOs formed at the edge of the cluster while the stellar wind from the UCHii region and the NIR cluster drives the large scale bubble. <P />},

	Abstract = {New observations are presented of [0 ii] X 3729/X 3726 intensity ratios at selected points in the Orion Nebula, as well as estimates of [0 iij/[O iiij and [0 iij/Hp ratios. A schematized, spherically symmetric model of the nebula is constructed, which reproduces, in the mean, the observed line-intensity ratios. However, the optical surface-brightness data and particularly the radio flux-density observations prove that this model, in which the density varies only slowly with position, cannot be correct but that, instead, there must be extreme density fluctuations in the nebula. Though the model with fluctuations cannot be completely specified from the available data, a particular case is analyzed, in which all the matter is in dense condensations distributed at random in a medium with zero density. For this model the density in the condensations is the same as the density at corresponding points in the model without fluctuations, but only about one-thirtieth of the whole volume is occupied by matter. The total mass of the interstellar matter in this model is about 60 solar masses.},

	Abstract = {We present a new high quality continuum-subtracted Hα image of NGC 7479. Using a novel semi-automated technique we have determined the positions, angular sizes, and absolute fluxes of over 1000 Hii regions and have constructed the luminosity function for the regions over the whole galaxy, showing that its slope is within the published range for spirals of the same morphological type. However NGC 7479 is notable in that its bar shows unusually strong star formation along the whole structure. This prompted us to undertake separate analyses of the Hii regions in the bar and in the disc. The disc luminosity function (LF) shows clean bi-linear behaviour as found previously in late-type spirals, with a break at log L_Hα = 38.6 erg s(-1) , whereas the bar LF shows a much less regular form. The difference is not due to the small numbers of Hii regions in the bar, but reflects a physical difference between the bar and the disc in the properties of their sets of regions. We show separate plots of the parameters for Hii regions in the bar and the disc selected for their regular shapes and absence of blending. We have derived galaxy-wide relations for the Hii region set: the diameter distribution function, luminosity versus volume and number versus luminosity versus diameter, and deduced the global Hα surface density distribution and disc scale length. Measuring the integrated diffuse Hα flux for the galaxy, we compare this with the computed ionizing flux escaping from the population of density-bounded Hii regions, finding that both in terms of energy balance and of geometry, the hypothesis that this escaping flux gives rise to the diffuse Hα is well borne out in NGC 7479, and that a significant fraction of this flux escapes completely into the intergalactic medium.},

	Abstract = {Using the OSIRIS tunable narrowband imager on the 10.4 m GTC (La Palma), we have mapped the SAB(rs)cd galaxy NGC 6946 over a ~7.3 × 7.5 arcmin<SUP>2</SUP> field in the emission lines of the [S II] λλ6717, 6731 doublet, and in Hα. From these maps we have produced catalogs of the Hα luminosities and effective radii of 557 H II regions across the disk, and derived the [S II] emission line ratios of 370 of these. The Hα observations were used to derive the mean luminosity-weighted electron densities for the regions of the sample, while the [S II] line ratios allowed us to derive values of the in situ electron densities in the denser zones from which the major fraction of the radiation in these lines is emitted for 58 of the regions. This is by far the largest data set of its kind for a single galaxy. A classical two-phase model is used to derive the filling factors of the regions. We find that although the mean electron density decreases with the square root of the radius of the regions, the in situ density is essentially independent of this radius. Thus the filling factor falls systematically, as the radius and the luminosity of the regions increases, with a power law of exponent -2.23 between filling factor and radius. These measurements should enhance the perspectives for more refined physical models of H II regions.},

	Abstract = {We present a detailed photoionization model of G29.96-0.02 (hereafter G29.96), one of the brightest Galactic Ultra Compact H Ii (UCHII) regions in the Galaxy. This source has been observed extensively at radio and infrared wavelengths. The most recent data include a complete ISO (SWS and LWS) spectrum, which displays a remarkable richness in atomic fine-structure lines. The number of observables is twice as great as the number available in previous studies. In addition, most atomic species are now observed in two ionization stages. The radio and infrared data on G29.96 are best reproduced using a nebular model with two density components: a diffuse (n<SUB>e</SUB> ~ 680 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) extended (~ 1 pc) component surrounding a compact ( ~ 0.1 pc) dense (n<SUB>e</SUB> ~ 57 000 cm<SUP>-3</SUP>) core. The properties of the ionizing star were derived using state-of-the-art stellar atmosphere models. CoStar models yield an effective temperature of ~ 30<SUP>+2</SUP><SUB>-1</SUB> kK whereas more recent non-LTE line blanketed atmospheres with stellar winds indicate somewhat higher values, T<SUB>eff</SUB> ~ 32-38 kK. This range in T<SUB>eff</SUB> is compatible with all observational constraints, including near-infrared photometry and bolometric luminosity. The range 33-36 kK is also compatible with the spectral type O5-O8 determined by \citet WH97  when recent downward revisions of the effective temperature scale of O stars are taken into account. The age of the ionizing star of G29.96 is found to be a few 10<SUP>6</SUP> yr, much older than the expected lifetime of UCHII regions. Accurate gas phase abundances are derived with the most robust results being Ne/S = 7.5 and N/O = 0.43 (1.3 and 3.5 times the solar values, respectively). Based on observations with ISO, an ESA project with instruments funded by ESA Member States (especially the PI countries: France, Germany, The Netherlands and the United Kingdom) and with the participation of ISAS and NASA.},

	Abstract = {The combination of dispersion measures of pulsars, distances from the model of Cordes &amp; Lazio (\cite cordes+lazio02 ) and emission measures from the WHAM survey enabled a statistical study of electron densities and filling factors of the diffuse ionized gas (DIG) in the Milky Way. The emission measures were corrected for absorption and contributions from beyond the pulsar distance. For a sample of 157 pulsars at |b|&gt;5$\,^{\circ}$ and 60$\,^{\circ}$ &lt; ℓ &lt; 360$\,^{\circ}$, located in mainly interarm regions within about 3 kpc from the Sun, we find that: (1) The average volume filling factor along the line of sight /line f <SUB>v</SUB> and the mean density in ionized clouds /line n <SUB>c</SUB> are inversely correlated: /line f <SUB>v</SUB>(/line n <SUB>c</SUB> ) = (0.0184$\pm$ 0.0011) /line n <SUB>c</SUB><SUP> </SUP> -1.07$\pm$ 0.03  for the ranges 0.03 &lt; /line n <SUB>c</SUB> &lt; 2  cm<SUP>-3</SUP> and 0.8 &gt; /line f <SUB>v</SUB> &gt; 0.01. This relationship is very tight. The inverse correlation of /line f <SUB>v</SUB> and /line n <SUB>c</SUB> causes the well-known constancy of the average electron density along the line of sight. As /line f <SUB>v</SUB>(z) increases with distance from the Galactic plane |z|, the average size of the ionized clouds increases with |z|. (2) For |z| &lt; 0.9 kpc the local density in clouds n<SUB>c</SUB> (z) and local filling factor f(z) are inversely correlated because the local electron density n<SUB>e</SUB> (z) = f(z) n<SUB>c</SUB> (z) is constant. We suggest that f(z) reaches a maximum value of &gt;0.3 near |z| = 0.9 kpc, whereas n<SUB>c</SUB> (z) continues to decrease to higher |z|, thus causing the observed flattening in the distribution of dispersion measures perpendicular to the Galactic plane above this height. (3) For |z| &lt; 0.9 kpc the local distributions n<SUB>c</SUB> (z), f(z) and n<SUB>e</SUB><SUP>2</SUP>(z) have the same scale height which is in the range 250 &lt; h ⪉ 500 pc. (4) The average degree of ionization of the warm atomic gas /line I <SUB>w</SUB> (z) increases towards higher |z| similarly to /line f <SUB>v</SUB> (z). Towards |z| = 1 kpc, /line f <SUB>v</SUB> (z) = 0.24$\pm$ 0.05 and /line I <SUB>w</SUB> (z) = 0.24$\pm$ 0.02. Near |z| = 1 kpc most of the warm, atomic hydrogen is ionized.},

	Abstract = {Radio synthesis imaging is dependent upon deconvolution algorithms to counteract the sparse sampling of the Fourier plane. These deconvolution algorithms find an estimate of the true sky brightness from the necessarily incomplete sampled visibility data. The most widely used radio synthesis deconvolution method is the CLEAN algorithm of Hogbom. This algorithm works extremely well for collections of point sources and surprisingly well for extended objects. However, the performance for extended objects can be improved by adopting a multiscale approach. We describe and demonstrate a conceptually simple and algorithmically straightforward extension to CLEAN that models the sky brightness by the summation of components of emission having different size scales. While previous multiscale algorithms work sequentially on decreasing scale sizes, our algorithm works simultaneously on a range of specified scales. Applications to both real and simulated data sets are given. <P />},

	Abstract = {High-resolution proxy data analyzed on two high-sedimentation shallow water sedimentary sequences (PO287-26B and PO287-28B) recovered off Lisbon (Portugal) provide the means for comparison to long-term instrumental time series of marine and atmospheric parameters (sea surface temperature (SST), precipitation, total river flow, and upwelling intensity computed from sea level pressure) and the possibility to do the necessary calibration for the quantification of past climate conditions. XRF Fe is used as proxy for river flow, and the upwelling-related diatom genus Chaetoceros is our upwelling proxy. SST is estimated from the coccolithophore-synthesized alkenones and U<SUB>37</SUB> <SUP>k′</SUP> index. Comparison of the Fe record to the instrumental data reveals its similarity to a mean average run of the instrumentally measured winter (JFMA) river flow on both sites. The upwelling diatom record concurs with the upwelling indices at both sites; however, high opal dissolution, below 20-25 cm, prevents its use for quantitative reconstructions. Alkenone-derived SST at site 28B does not show interannual variation; it has a mean value around 16$\,^{\circ}$C and compares quite well with the instrumental winter/spring temperature. At site 26B the mean SST is the same, but a high degree of interannual variability (up to 4$\,^{\circ}$C) appears to be determined by summer upwelling conditions. Stepwise regression analyses of the instrumental and proxy data sets provided regressions that explain from 65 to 94% of the variability contained in the original data, and reflect spring and summer river flow, as well as summer and winter upwelling indices, substantiating the relevance of seasons to the interpretation of the different proxy signals. The lack of analogs and the small data set available do not allow quantitative reconstructions at this time, but this might be a powerful tool for reconstructing past North Atlantic Oscillation conditions, should we be able to find continuous high-resolution records and overcome the analog problem. <P />},

	Abstract = {In high-resolution radio interferometry it is often impossible for practical reasons to arrange for the measured baselines to be regularly distributed. The standard Fourier inversion methods may then produce maps which are seriously confused by the effects of the prominent and extended sidelobe patterns of the corresponding synthesized beam. Some methods which have been proposed for avoiding these difficulties are discussed. In particular, the procedure CLEAN is described in some detail. This has been successfully applied to measurements taken with several different radio telescopes and appears to be the best method available at the time of writing.},

	Abstract = {Context. Sagittarius B2 (north) is a chemically rich, high-mass star-forming region located within the giant molecular cloud complex Sgr B2 in the central molecular zone of our Galaxy. Dust continuum emission at 242 GHz, obtained at high angular resolution with the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA), reveals that it has a filamentary structure on scales of 0.1 pc. <BR /> Aims: We aim to characterize the filamentary structure of Sgr B2(N) and its kinematic properties using multiple molecular dense gas tracers. <BR /> Methods: We have used an unbiased, spectral line-survey that covers the frequency range from 211 to 275 GHz and obtained with ALMA (angular resolution of 0.''4, or 3300 au) to study the small-scale structure of the dense gas in Sgr B2(N). In order to derive the kinematic properties of the gas in a chemically line-rich source like Sgr B2(N), we have developed a python-based tool that stacks all the detected line transitions of any molecular species. This allows us to increase the signal-to-noise ratio (S/N) of our observations and average out line blending effects, which are common in line-rich regions. <BR /> Results: A filamentary network is visible in Sgr B2(N) in the emission maps of the molecular species CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCHO, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OCH<SUB>3</SUB>, CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH and H<SUB>2</SUB>CS. In total, eight filaments are found that converge to the central hub (with a mass of 2000 M<SUB>☉</SUB>, assuming a temperature of 250 K) and extending for about 0.1 pc (up to 0.5 pc). The spatial structure, together with the presence of the massive central region, suggest that these filaments may be associated with accretion processes, transporting material from the outer regions to the central dense hub. We derive velocity gradients along the filaments of about 20-100 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> pc<SUP>-1</SUP>, which are 10-100 times larger than those typically found on larger scales ( 1 pc) in other star-forming regions. The mass accretion rates of individual filaments are ≾0.05 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>, which result in a total accretion rate of 0.16 M<SUB>☉</SUB> yr<SUP>-1</SUP>. Some filaments harbor dense cores that are likely forming stars and stellar clusters. We determine an empirical relation between the luminosity and stellar mass of the clusters. The stellar content of these dense cores is on the order of 50% of the total mass. The timescales required for the dense cores to collapse and form stars, exhausting their gas content, are compared with the timescale of their accretion process onto the central hub. We conclude that the cores may merge in the center when already forming stellar clusters but still containing a significant amount of gas, resulting in a "damp" merger. <BR /> Conclusions: The high density and mass of the central region, combined with the presence of converging filaments with high mass, high accretion rates and embedded dense cores already forming stars, suggest that Sgr B2(N) may have the potential to evolve into a super stellar cluster.},

@article{Ossenkopf:1994aa,
	Abstract = {Basing on the coagulation model of Ossenkopf (1993), we systematically computed and tabulated the opacity of dust in dense protostellar cores between 1μm and 1.3mm. The possible physical conditions were varied especially considering the influence of different gas densities and molecular depletion ratios. In comparison to the dust opacity in the diffuse interstellar medium, we found nowhere changes by more than the factor 5 for ice-covered dust grains. Possible uncertainties and deviations in environments with different physical conditions are discussed. Although one may imagine very special situations in which the dust opacity is changed by more than a factor 10, for physically reasonable conditions in dense protostellar cores, all possible deviations from the tabulated values may not sum up to more than a factor 2. Using these tables of dust opacities, the submm continuum radiation of cold dust in protostellar cores is a good tracer of their total mass.},

	Abstract = {We present the catalog of X-ray sources detected in a shallow Chandra survey of the inner 2<SUP>deg</SUP>×0.8d of the Galaxy and in two deeper observations of the Radio Arches and Sgr B2. The catalog contains 1352 objects that are highly absorbed (N<SUB>H</SUB>&gt;~4×10<SUP>22</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) and are therefore likely to lie near the Galactic center (D~8 kpc), and 549 less absorbed sources that lie within &lt;~6 kpc of Earth. On the basis of the inferred luminosities of the X-ray sources and the expected numbers of various classes of objects, we suggest that the sources with L<SUB>X</SUB>&lt;~10<SUP>33</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP> that comprise ~90% of the catalog are cataclysmic variables and that the ~100 brighter objects are accreting neutron stars and black holes, young isolated pulsars, and Wolf-Rayet and O (WR/O) stars in colliding-wind binaries. We find that the spatial distribution of X-ray sources matches that of the old stellar population observed in the infrared, which supports our suggestion that most of the X-ray sources are old cataclysmic variables. However, we find that there is an apparent excess of ~10 bright sources in the Radio Arches region. That region is already known to be the site of recent star formation, so we suggest that the bright sources in this region are young high-mass X-ray binaries, pulsars, or WR/O star binaries. We briefly discuss some astrophysical questions that this catalog can be used to address.},

	Abstract = {We report the X-ray population study in the giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2). More than a dozen X-ray cloud members (and candidates) are discovered with Chandra. Two bright X-ray sources are located near Sgr B2 Main, the most copious complex of the ultracompact H II sources. The X-ray spectra are fitted with a thin thermal plasma model of 5-10 keV temperature. The intrinsic luminosity, after correcting the absorption of ~5×10<SUP>23</SUP>Hcm<SUP>-2</SUP>, is ~10<SUP>33</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. Although these two X-ray sources are attributable to young stellar objects (YSOs) in the same H II complex, they are in sharp contrast; the one at the center of the H II complex exhibits strong K-shell transition lines of iron, while the other near the east has only weak lines. The other H II complexes, Sgr B2 North and South, also show hard and highly absorbed X-ray emissions due possibly to the star formation activity. The composite X-ray spectrum of the other cloud member X-ray sources is fitted with a thin thermal plasma of ~10 keV temperature with hydrogen column density (N<SUB>H</SUB>) of 1.3×10<SUP>23</SUP>Hcm<SUP>-2</SUP> and individual X-ray luminosity of a few times 10<SUP>31</SUP>-10<SUP>32</SUP> ergs s<SUP>-1</SUP>. These are likely to be a single YSO or cluster of YSOs, but neither radio nor infrared counterpart is found. An alternative scenario of isolated white dwarfs powered by Bondi-Hoyle accretion from the dense cloud gas is also discussed. The X-ray spectra exhibit an additional 6.4 keV line of neutral or low-ionization irons, which indicates that the environment gas is concentrated near the sources.},

	Abstract = {A new seven-beam 6-7GHz receiver has been built to survey the Galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds for newly forming high-mass stars that are pinpointed by strong methanol maser emission at 6668MHz. The receiver was jointly constructed by Jodrell Bank Observatory (JBO) and the Australia Telescope National Facility (ATNF) and allows simultaneous coverage at 6668 and 6035MHz. It was successfully commissioned at Parkes in 2006 January and is now being used to conduct the Parkes-Jodrell multibeam maser survey of the Milky Way. This will be the first systematic survey of the entire Galactic plane for masers of not only 6668-MHz methanol, but also 6035-MHz excited-state hydroxyl. The survey is two orders of magnitude faster than most previous systematic surveys and has an rms noise level of ~0.17Jy. This paper describes the observational strategy, techniques and reduction procedures of the Galactic and Magellanic Cloud surveys, together with deeper, pointed, follow-up observations and complementary observations with other instruments. It also includes an estimate of the survey detection efficiency. The 111d of observations with the Parkes telescope have so far yielded &gt;800 methanol sources, of which ~350 are new discoveries. The whole project will provide the first comprehensive Galaxy-wide catalogue of 6668-MHz and 6035-MHz masers.},

	Abstract = {Context. Isocyanic acid (HNCO) has been observed in different physical environments in the interstellar medium (ISM) and in external galaxies. HNCO has several metastable isomers with a ground electronic singlet state: HOCN, HCNO, and HONC. The recent detection of fulminic acid (HCNO) in prestellar and protostellar cores and cyanic acid (HOCN) in warm molecular sources (e.g. hot cores) in the Galactic center proves that these species could also be common constituents of the ISM. <BR /> Aims: To shed some light on the possible formation pathways of these species, we searched for HCNO in the sources where HOCN has been previously detected and vice versa. We have also included the low-mass protostar IRAS 16293-2422, where HNCO is found to be prominent. <BR /> Methods: Using the new EMIR receivers at the IRAM 30-m telescope, we performed deep searches for three rotational transitions of HOCN and four of HCNO. <BR /> Results: We report the detection of HOCN in four sources - three dense cores and the lukewarm corino L1527 - where HCNO has been previously observed. HOCN is tentatively detected toward the protostellar binary IRAS 16293-2422. However, HCNO has been detected neither in this source nor in the sources of the Galactic center where HOCN has been previously reported. The derived abundance ratios HCNO/HOCN are close to unity in quiescent clouds, while they are less than 0.01-0.1 in warm clouds. We attempt to explain these results by using both gas-phase and gas-grain chemical models. <P />This work was based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30-m telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany) and IGN (Spain).},

	Abstract = {We have identified and classified Zeeman pairs in the survey by Argon, Reid, &amp; Menten of massive star-forming regions with 18 cm (<SUP>2</SUP>Π<SUB>3/2</SUB>,J=3/2) OH maser emission. We have found a total of more than 100 Zeeman pairs in more than 50 massive star-forming regions. The magnetic field deduced from the Zeeman splitting has allowed us to assign an overall line-of-sight magnetic field direction to many of the massive star-forming regions. Combining these data with other data sets obtained from OH Zeeman splitting, we have looked for correlations of magnetic field directions between star-forming regions scattered throughout the Galaxy. Our data do not support a uniform, Galactic-scale field direction, nor do we find any strong evidence of magnetic field correlations within spiral arms. However, our data suggest that in the solar neighborhood the magnetic field outside the solar circle is oriented clockwise as viewed from the north Galactic pole, while inside the solar circle it is oriented counterclockwise. This pattern, including the magnetic field reversal near the Sun, is in agreement with results obtained from pulsar rotation measures.},

	Abstract = {A search for maser emission at the 1720-MHz transition of OH has been made with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) towards more than 200 southern sites of 1665- and 6035-MHz OH masers. 28 of the 36 detected 1720-MHz masers precisely coincide with the targets (15 previously known; 13 new discoveries) and are thus almost certainly of the star formation region (SFR) variety. Our observations revealed highly variable intensities for some previously known 1720-MHz masers, in extreme cases now preventing their detection. We interpret six new masers serendipitously discovered offset from any target position as an SFR subclass. Two other masers were chance detections of a quite different maser class associated with supernova remnants. Several instances of prominent 1720-MHz OH absorption occur. <P />The 1720-MHz masers mostly coincide, to arcsecond accuracy, with a stronger 1665-MHz OH maser counterpart; in a few instances, 1665-MHz counterparts are much weaker, and the six 1720-MHz masers discovered offset from any target position (with no detectable 1665-MHz emission) are the ultimate examples, qualifying them as a distinct SFR subclass. At the sensitivity of the current survey, we find that SFR 1720-MHz masers are approximately one-sixth as common as 1665-MHz masers. The 1720-MHz masers preferentially occur at the sites hosting 6035-MHz masers - explicable in the context of current maser pumping models if 1720-MHz and 6035-MHz masers trace regions where the OH column density is higher, and the kinetic temperature lower, than at sites displaying only 1665-MHz masers. <P />For each 1720-MHz maser, spectra of the two circular polarizations at high-velocity resolution were taken with the Parkes telescope. Similar observations, to monitor several previously known northern 1720-MHz masers, augment the southern sample. The Parkes spectra commonly reveal Zeeman splitting in magnetic fields of a few milligauss, and the largest field is a `record-setting' 16 mG. Compared with fields derived from other OH transitions at the same site, the 1720-MHz values generally imply the same direction of field, but the field strength tends to be higher, by as much as a factor of 2. This may be understood if the 1720-MHz masers preferentially occur at locations compressed to higher density, with enhanced frozen-in magnetic field. Such higher fields support a pumping scheme requiring high densities for the 1720-MHz masers. <P />Towards most of the 1720-MHz maser sites lies an associated 6668-MHz methanol maser, consistent with pumping expectations that the methanol masers are also favoured by high densities. We also explore some sites in more detail, with new results obtained in the radio continuum and recombination lines, and at other masing transitions - a new position for 328.809+0.633 at the 1612-MHz OH transition, for example, confirms a rare spatial near-coincidence with a 1720-MHz maser (although offset in velocity).},

	Abstract = {Massive newly formed stars are obscured by dust, and their clearest signature is often at radio frequencies from strong molecular maser emission. In some cases, both hydroxyl and methanol masers are present. Maser position measurements of both species are then especially useful for exploring the immediate surroundings of the new-born star. The present study used the Australia Telescope Compact Array to observe 6.035-GHz OH maser emission in 35 fields; 30 of these were also observed at the 6.668-GHz methanol transition. In many of the fields the masers were found to be grouped into several distinct maser sites, allowing a total of 62 sites to be studied. Relative positions at 6.035 and 6.668GHz could be registered to an accuracy of 0.1arcsec. 29 sites harbour both 6.035-GHz OH and 6.668-GHz methanol, and most of these have sufficient maser features to reveal that the distributions of OH and methanol are largely co-extensive, with total extents between 10 and 30mpc (milliparsec). Elongated morphologies are common in both the OH and methanol distributions. The new-born star associated with each group of masers is not visible, but is expected to generate an enveloping ultracompact H II region. Such H II regions have been detected (as compact radio sources, mostly by searching continuum images made from the present observations) at 23 of the present maser sites. For these, the projected distribution of the masers was mapped relative to the H II region. In most cases, the masers are confined to a zone that covers only a portion of the H II region, and is commonly offset from the centre of the H II region, but rarely lies at its projected boundary. The masing zone can be plausibly identified as centred on the (unseen) principal exciting star of the H II region, with the maser distribution corresponding to a torus or ring, in some cases small enough to suggest that it may be embedded within the H II region. The fact that the typical extent is confined to less than 30mpc can be used in some cases to establish distances once the angular extent has been measured. The sample of maser sites studied here is OH-selected and thus biased towards sites with strong OH emission. The high rate of strong H II region detections among them indicates a marked trend (but not a close correlation) for H II regions to be more prominent towards OH-favoured maser sites than methanol-favoured sites.},

	Abstract = {Full polarization measurements of 1665- and 1667-MHz OH masers at sites of massive star formation have been made with the Parkes 64-m radio telescope. Here, we present the resulting spectra for 104 northerly sources, from Galactic longitude 350$\,^{\circ}$ through the Galactic Centre to 41$\,^{\circ}$. Some maser positions were previously uncertain by many arcseconds, and thus for more than 20 masers we made new measurements with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (which also revealed several hitherto unreported masers), in most cases yielding arcsecond precision to match the majority of sites. Position improvements have assisted us in distinguishing OH masers with accompanying methanol masers from those without (thought to be at a later stage of evolution). There was no existing linear polarization information at many sites, and spectral resolution was sometimes poor, or velocity coverage incomplete. These inadequacies are addressed by the present Parkes spectra. The whole OH maser sample exhibits the well-known predominance of highly circularly polarized features. We find that linear polarization is also common, but usually much weaker, and we highlight the rare cases of very pronounced linear polarization that can extend to 100 per cent. Unusually large velocity ranges of at least 25 km s<SUP>-1</SUP> are present at seven sites. Our spectra measurements for most sources are at two epochs spaced by nearly one year, and reveal high stability at most sites, and marked variability (more than factors of 2 in the strongest feature) at only five sites. The spectra also provide a valuable reference for longer term variability, with high stability evident over the past few decades at 10 sites and marked variability for four of the sample. Future systematic monitoring of these variables may uncover further examples of periodicity, a phenomenon so far recognized in only one source.},

A total of 18 compact regions showing maser emission are found, which are spread over 2.1 pc × 4.3 pc (α × δ) region. Many of these are offset far from known molecular cores and ultracompact H II regions and may trace the interaction region of a cloud-cloud collision. There is no spatial coincidence between 44 GHz and 6.7 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH masers in this region, as expected, because the pumping mechanisms for these two transitions are different. Isotropic maser luminosities range between 1 × 10<SUP>-6</SUP> and 2.1 × 10<SUP>-5</SUP> L<SUB>☉</SUB>. In addition, 17 regions with broad line width quasi-thermal 44 GHz CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH emission are identified, many of which are close to known molecular hot cores, in particular those associated with the Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) continuum sources. In Sgr B2(N), quasi-thermal emission appears to be associated with two 10" diameter ionized shells. These ionized shells may have swept up and shocked molecular material as they expanded. Also, a quasi-thermal core is observed to be coincident with a source of continuum emission from dust and emission from more complex species. In Sgr B2(M), CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH quasi-thermal emission arises predominantly from the western portion of this region. The CH<SUB>3</SUB>OH fractional abundance in most of the quasi-thermal cores appears to be quite high at ~10<SUP>-6</SUP>. It is argued that grain-surface chemistry is responsible for this high abundance.},

	Abstract = {We have conducted a Galactic plane survey of methanol masers at 6668 MHz using a seven-beam receiver on the Parkes telescope. Here we present results from the first part, which provides sensitive unbiased coverage of a large region around the Galactic Centre. Details are given for 183 methanol maser sites in the longitude range 345$\,^{\circ}$ through the Galactic Centre to 6$\,^{\circ}$. Within 6$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Centre, we found 88 maser sites, of which more than half (48) are new discoveries. The masers are confined to a narrow Galactic latitude range, indicative of many sources at the Galactic Centre distance and beyond, and confined to a thin disc population; there is no high-latitude population that might be ascribed to the Galactic bulge. <P />Within 2$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic Centre the maser velocities all lie between -60 and +77kms<SUP>-1</SUP>, a range much smaller than the 540kms<SUP>-1</SUP> range observed in CO. Elsewhere, the maser with highest positive velocity (+107kms<SUP>-1</SUP>) occurs, surprisingly, near longitude 355$\,^{\circ}$ and is probably attributable to the Galactic bar. The maser with the most negative velocity (-127kms<SUP>-1</SUP>) is near longitude 346$\,^{\circ}$, within the longitude-velocity locus of the near side of the `3-kpc arm'. It has the most extreme velocity of a clear population of masers associated with the near and far sides of the 3-kpc arm. Closer to the Galactic Centre the maser space density is generally low, except within 0.25 kpc of the Galactic Centre itself, the `Galactic Centre zone', where it is 50 times higher, which is hinted at by the longitude distribution, and confirmed by the unusual velocities.},

Distances for a large subsample of 1120 masers are derived, using the galactic rotation curve for SFR and literature data for STAR.The parameters of the H<SUB>2</SUB>O maser emission (e.g. integrated flux, luminosity, variability), collected in a homogeneous way in the Arcetri H<SUB>2</SUB>O atlas (Comoretto et al. 1990), and those of the associated IRAS sources (e.g. flux density, luminosity, colours) are used to investigate, in a statistical way, the properties of the STAR and SFR classes. In particular, we investigate the spatial distribution of masers both in the galactic plane and perpendicular to it. We also compare the H<SUB>2</SUB>O and IRAS luminosities, finding a good correlation. Moreover, we find that high luminosity sources show low colour temperatures and vice versa. The spectral profile and variability are then investigated by different means. Finally, the luminosity function for each maser class is derived.},

	Abstract = {The Australia Telescope Compact Array has been used to observe more than 200 1665-MHz hydroxyl masers south of declination -16 deg and derive their positions with typical rms uncertainties of 0.4 arcsec. Many of the 1665-MHz maser sites are found to have 1667-MHz OH maser counterparts which are coincident, within the errors. The resulting position list presented here includes all well-documented, previously reported 1665-MHz masers close to the Galactic plane in the galactic longitude range 230 deg (through 360 deg) to 13 deg. Nearly 50 newly discovered masers are also listed, chiefly in the longitude range 312 deg to 356 deg, where the observations were conducted as an intensive survey of a continuous zone close to the Galactic plane. Many of the maser sites are discussed briefly so as to draw attention to those possessing properties that are unusual among this large sample. Most of the masers are of the variety found in star-forming regions - at the sites of newly formed massive stars and their associated ultracompact H ii regions. The new, accurate, positions reveal coincidences of the OH masers with the continuum radio emission, with the infrared emission from dust that accompanies such regions, and with emission from other maser species such as methanol at 6668 MHz and water at 22 GHz. By-products of the survey, also presented here, include measurements of at least 11 objects that are not associated with massive star-forming regions. They comprise several OH/IR stars (detected at the 1667- or 1665-MHz transition of OH, though commonly found to be most prominent at the 1612-MHz transition) and several unusual masers that may pinpoint other varieties of late-type stars or protoplanetary nebulae.},

	Abstract = {Context. We present an initial overview of the filamentary structure in the Orion A molecular cloud utilizing a high angular and velocity resolution C18O(1-0) emission map that was recently produced as part of the CARMA-NRO Orion Survey. <BR /> Aims: The main goal of this study is to build a credible method to study varying widths of filaments which has previously been linked to star formation in molecular clouds. Due to the diverse star forming activities taking place throughout its 20 pc length, together with its proximity of 388 pc, the Orion A molecular cloud provides an excellent laboratory for such an experiment to be carried out with high resolution and high sensitivity. <BR /> Methods: Using the widely-known structure identification algorithm, DisPerSE, on a three-dimensional (PPV) C18O cube, we identify 625 relatively short (the longest being 1.74 pc) filaments over the entire cloud. We studied the distribution of filament widths using FilChaP, a python package that we have developed and made publicly available. <BR /> Results: We find that the filaments identified in a two square-degree PPV cube do not overlap spatially, except for the complex OMC-4 region that shows distinct velocity components along the line of sight. The filament widths vary between 0.02 and 0.3 pc depending on the amount of substructure that a filament possesses. The more substructure a filament has, the larger is its width. We also find that despite this variation, the filament width shows no anticorrelation with the central column density which is in agreement with previous Herschel observations.},

	Abstract = {Context. We model the emission of methyl cyanide (CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN) lines towards the massive hot molecular core Sgr B2(M). <BR /> Aims: We aim to reconstruct the CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN abundance field, and investigate the gas temperature distribution as well as the velocity field. <BR /> Methods: Sgr B2(M) was observed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) in a spectral line survey from 211 to 275 GHz. This frequency range includes several transitions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN (including isotopologues and vibrationally excited states). We employed the three-dimensional radiative transfer toolbox Pandora in order to retrieve the velocity and abundance field by modeling different CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN lines. For this purpose, we based our model on the results of a previous study that determined the physical structure of Sgr B2(M), i.e., the distribution of dust dense cores, ionized regions, and heating sources. <BR /> Results: The morphology of the CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN emission can be reproduced by a molecular density field that consists of a superposition of cores with modified Plummer-like density profiles. The averaged relative abundance of CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN with respect to H<SUB>2</SUB> ranges from 4 × 10<SUP>-11</SUP> to 2 × 10<SUP>-8</SUP> in the northern part of Sgr B2(M) and from 2 × 10<SUP>-10</SUP> to 5 × 10<SUP>-7</SUP> in the southern part. In general, we find that the relative abundance of CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN is lower at the center of the very dense, hot cores, causing the general morphology of the CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN emission to be shifted with respect to the dust continuum emission. The dust temperature calculated by the radiative transfer simulation based on the available luminosity reaches values up to 900 K. However, in some regions vibrationally excited transitions of CH<SUB>3</SUB>CN are underestimated by the model, indicating that the predicted gas temperature, which is assumed to be equal to the dust temperature, is partly underestimated. The determination of the velocity component along the line of sight reveals that a velocity gradient from the north to the south exists in Sgr B2(M).},

The Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) was completed in 2003 and its final data products, including an extended source catalog (XSC), are available online. The 2MASS XSC contains nearly a million galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> &lt;= 13.5 mag and is essentially complete and mostly unaffected by interstellar extinction and stellar confusion down to a galactic latitude of |b| = 5$\,^{\circ}$ for bright galaxies. Near-infrared wavelengths are sensitive to the old stellar populations that dominate galaxy masses, making 2MASS an excellent starting point to study the distribution of matter in the nearby universe. We selected a sample of 44,599 2MASS galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> &lt;= 11.75 mag and |b| &gt;= 5$\,^{\circ}$ (&gt;=8$\,^{\circ}$ toward the Galactic bulge) as the input catalog for our survey. We obtained spectroscopic observations for 11,000 galaxies and used previously obtained velocities for the remainder of the sample to generate a redshift catalog that is 97.6% complete to well-defined limits and covers 91% of the sky. This provides an unprecedented census of galaxy (baryonic mass) concentrations within 300 Mpc. Earlier versions of our survey have been used in a number of publications that have studied the bulk motion of the Local Group, mapped the density and peculiar velocity fields out to 50 h <SUP>-1</SUP> Mpc, detected galaxy groups, and estimated the values of several cosmological parameters. Additionally, we present morphological types for a nearly complete sub-sample of 20,860 galaxies with K<SUB>s</SUB> &lt;= 11.25 mag and |b| &gt;= 10$\,^{\circ}$.},

@article{Vaupre:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Cosmic rays are an essential ingredient in the evolution of the interstellar medium, as they dominate the ionisation of the dense molecular gas, where stars and planets form. However, since they are efficiently scattered by the galactic magnetic fields, many questions remain open, such as where exactly they are accelerated, what is their original energy spectrum, and how they propagate into molecular clouds. In this work we present new observations and discuss in detail a method that allows us to measure the cosmic ray ionisation rate towards the molecular clouds close to the W28 supernova remnant. To perform these measurements, we use CO, HCO+, and DCO+ millimetre line observations and compare them with the predictions of radiative transfer and chemical models away from thermodynamical equilibrium. The CO observations allow us to constrain the density, temperature, and column density towards each observed position, while the DCO+/HCO+ abundance ratios provide us with constraints on the electron fraction and, consequently, on the cosmic ray ionisation rate. Towards positions located close to the supernova remnant, we find cosmic ray ionisation rates much larger (≳100) than those in standard galactic clouds. Conversely, towards one position situated at a larger distance, we derive a standard cosmic ray ionisation rate. Overall, these observations support the hypothesis that the gamma rays observed in the region have a hadronic origin. In addition, based on CR diffusion estimates, we find that the ionisation of the gas is likely due to 0.1-1 GeV cosmic rays. Finally, these observations are also in agreement with the global picture of cosmic ray diffusion, in which the low-energy tail of the cosmic ray population diffuses at smaller distances than the high-energy counterpart.},

	Abstract = {Aperture synthesis instruments providing a generally highly uniform sampling of the visibility function often leave an unsampled hole near the origin of the (u,v)-plane. In this paper, originally published in 1979, we first describe the common solution of retrieving the information from scans made with a large single-dish telescope. However, this is not the only means by which short spacing visibility data can be obtained. We propose an alternative technique that employs a short-baseline interferometer to scan the entire primary beam area. The obvious advantage is that a short-baseline pair from the synthesis instrument can be used, ensuring uniformity in instrumental characteristics. This technique is the basis for the mosaicing algorithms now commonly used in aperture synthesis radio astronomy imaging.},

	Abstract = {We have observed the barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 with the VLA in the BnA, CnB, and DnC configurations. We have refined the flux determination for partially cleaned images of very non-Gaussian VLA multiconfiguration naturally weighted beams as described in the Appendix. NGC 1365 is found to contain 15.2 x 1O^9^M_sun_ of HI. The velocity field is strongly affected by the bar in the inner parts, but it is relatively undisturbed in the outer parts. The H I morphology is similar to that in the optical, but the HI is more uniformly distributed and there is no trace of the bar. NGC 1365 is found to have four well developed arms and two rudimentary ones. The inclination of the inner disk is determined to be 40^deg^, substantially different from that obtained by optical means (55^deg^). There is a central H I hole which is filled with molecular gas. We find that NGC 1365 has the most strongly dropping rotation curve known to us, falling to 63% of its peak value. It starts to drop already at 2/3 of R_25_. In the outer 40% it is well modeled by a Keplerian. We deduce a total mass for NGC 1365 of 3.9 x 10^11^ M_sun_, resulting in a M/L_B_ of 4.8. Strongly noncircular motions (radial velocity residuals up to 100 km s^-1^) are seen in the bar region. The influence of the bar drops rapidly outside of it and the orbits become rather circular. The ratio between H I diameter and R_25_ is unusually small and NGC 1365 lacks a extended H I halo. A similar behavior is displayed by NGC 1300, data for which we have reduced anew, and we discuss whether this could be common among strongly barred galaxies. NGC 1365 has a warp which starts already at 2/3 of R_25_. The classical resonances may be identified with kinematical and morphological features of the spiral arms. The good agreement with gas dynamical models give strong support to this identification. We find a common corotation radius of arms and bar at 1.4 times the bar major axis. This corresponds to a pattern velocity of 21 +/- I km s^-`^ kpc^-1^. The -4/1 resonance is the most clearly seen feature. The corotation radius corresponds to the maximum deviation from circular motion in the arms. The bright parts of the arms end at the OLR. The spiral arms of NGC 1365 have a very circular symmetry when viewed face on, and are substantially more tightly wound than they appear in the sky plane. NGC 1365 shows a straight front on the W side, which may be a sign of interaction with the intergalactic medium. The H I is elongated in the direction of the Fornax cluster center.},

	Abstract = {We report the CO(J = 1-0) observations of the Whirlpool Galaxy M51 using both the Combined Array for Research in Millimeter Astronomy (CARMA) and the Nobeyama 45 m telescope (NRO45). We describe a procedure for the combination of interferometer and single-dish data. In particular, we discuss (1) the joint imaging and deconvolution of heterogeneous data, (2) the weighting scheme based on the root-mean-square (rms) noise in the maps, (3) the sensitivity and uv coverage requirements, and (4) the flux recovery of a combined map. We generate visibilities from the single-dish map and calculate the noise of each visibility based on the rms noise. Our weighting scheme, though it is applied to discrete visibilities in this paper, should be applicable to grids in uv space, and this scheme may advance in future software development. For a realistic amount of observing time, the sensitivities of the NRO45 and CARMA visibility data sets are best matched by using the single-dish baselines only up to 4-6 klambda (about 1/4-1/3 of the dish diameter). The synthesized beam size is determined to conserve the flux between the synthesized beam and convolution beam. The superior uv coverage provided by the combination of CARMA long baseline data with 15 antennas and NRO45 short spacing data results in the high image fidelity, which is evidenced by the excellent overlap between even the faint CO emission and dust lanes in an optical Hubble Space Telescope image and polycyclicaromatichydrocarbon emission in a Spitzer 8 mum image. The total molecular gas masses of NGC 5194 and 5195 (d = 8.2 Mpc) are 4.9 × 109 M sun and 7.8 × 107 M sun, respectively, assuming the CO-to-H2 conversion factor of X CO = 1.8 × 1020 cm-2(K km s-1)-1. The presented images are an indication of the millimeter-wave images that will become standard in the next decade with CARMA and NRO45, and the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array.},

	Abstract = {We present a new package for joint deconvolution of ALMA 12 m, 7 m, and Total Power (TP) data, dubbed ``Total Power Map to Visibilities (TP2VIS)''. It converts a TP (single-dish) map into visibilities on the CASA platform, which can be input into deconvolvers (e.g., CLEAN) along with 12 m and 7 m visibilities. The TP2VIS procedure is based primarily on the one discussed in Koda et al. A manual is presented in the GITHUB repository (https://github.com/tp2vis/distribute). Combining data from the different ALMA arrays is a driver for a number of science topics, namely those that probe size scales of extended and compact structures simultaneously (e.g., protostar outflows and environment, AGB stars and planetary nebulae, molecular clouds and cores, and molecular clouds in galaxies). We test TP2VIS using model images, one with a single Gaussian and another that mimics the internal structures of giant molecular clouds. The result shows that the better uv coverage with TP2VIS visibilities clearly helps the deconvolution process and reproduces the model image within errors of only 5% over two orders of magnitude in flux. In the Appendix, we describe how the model image is generated.},

@article{Anglada:1998aa,
	Abstract = {We present 6 cm VLA observations of nine regions with molecular or HH outflows that appear to be driven by young stellar objects of low bolometric luminosity. Radio continuum emission at 3.6 cm had been detected previously toward the center of symmetry of 13 outflows in these regions. With the new 6 cm observations we have been able to estimate the spectral index in the 6 to 3.6 cm wavelength range for 11 of these outflow central (Class 0 and Class I) sources. All the spectral indices obtained for these central sources are positive and consistent with partially thick thermal free-free emission. We discuss this result in relation to the current models for the origin of centimeter radio continuum emission in outflow sources. In particular, we find that the observed flux densities of these sources fit very well in the observational correlation between the radio continuum luminosity and the momentum rate of the outflow, and that the results are consistent with the central sources being thermal radio jets. Our data suggest that the ionized part of the jets begins at a distance <~10 AU from the star. In addition, we have derived a positive value for the spectral index of HH 32A, indicative of partially thick thermal emission. For the remaining sources detected in the nine fields observed, our results indicate that the emission is, in general, nonthermal, as expected for background extragalactic sources. However, a few of these sources could be related to the star-forming regions studied.},

	Abstract = {We present maps of a ~14 pc × 20 pc region covering the Sgr B2 molecular cloud complex in the 13CO (1-0) and CS (1-0) lines with high angular resolution. A more restricted central area was also mapped in the C18O (1-0) line. The 13CO cloud consists of two components: a compact core of ~3 pc in diameter roughly centered on Sgr B2(M) and an extended plateau of ~17 pc × 7.5 pc area containing the maser sources and most of the H II regions. Compact, massive (~3×105 Msolar) C18O cores are associated with Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N). The obtained intensity distributions are compared with those of molecular masers and compact H II regions reported in the literature. Low-velocity (40-65 km s-1) masers, with positions roughly aligned in the north-south line connecting the three major compact H II region complexes, are located near the eastern margin of a large hole in the low-velocity molecular cloud. In contrast, most of the high-velocity (65-80 km s-1) masers are distributed near the center of a compact molecular cloud at higher velocity, where a shock seems to have occurred. These results provide further evidence supporting the cloud-cloud collision hypothesis based on limited 13CO (1-0) data. In addition, this hypothesis appears to be consistent with a wide range of new observations that have appeared in the literature.},

	Abstract = {Three cometary-shaped objects in the giant H II region NGC 3603, originally found and identified as proto-planetary disks (proplyds) by Brandner and coworkers using the Hubble Space Telescope and the Very Large Telescope in the optical and near-infrared, have been detected with the Australia Telescope Compact Array5 in the radio continuum at 3 and 6 cm. All three proplyd-like objects are clearly resolved with an extent of a few arcseconds. The integrated 6 cm fluxes are up to 1.3 times higher than the 3 cm fluxes with spectral indices averaged over the whole clump between alpha=-0.1 and -0.5 (Snu~nualpha), indicating the likely presence of nonthermal emission in at least some of the sources. We present spectral-index maps and show that the sites of negative radio spectral indices are predominantly concentrated in the direction of the tails in at least two of the three proplyd-like nebulae, while positive spectral indices are found in the region facing the ionizing star cluster. We propose that thermal bremsstrahlung and nonthermal synchrotron radiation are at work in all three proplyd-like sources. In at least one of the three objects, optically thin nonthermal synchrotron emission appears to dominate when averaged over its whole spatial extent, while the spectrum of a second source shows a marginal indication of a nonthermal spectrum. The average spectrum of the third source is in agreement with thermal bremsstrahlung. All measured fluxes are at least one order of magnitude higher than those predicted by Brandner and coworkers. Upper limits for mass-loss rates due to photoevaporation are calculated to be ~10-5 Msolar yr-1 and for electron densities to be ~104 cm-3. Due to the unexpectedly large radio luminosities of the proplyd-like features and because the radio emission is extended, a (proto-) stellar origin of the nonthermal emission from a dust enshrouded star appears unlikely. Instead, we propose that magnetized regions within the envelope of the proplyd-like nebulae exist.},

	Abstract = {We aim to summarize the current state of knowledge regarding Galactic Faraday rotation in an all-sky map of the Galactic Faraday depth. For this we have assembled the most extensive catalog of Faraday rotation data of compact extragalactic polarized radio sources to date. In the map-making procedure we used a recently developed algorithm that reconstructs the map and the power spectrum of a statistically isotropic and homogeneous field while taking into account uncertainties in the noise statistics. This procedure is able to identify some rotation angles that are offset by an integer multiple of pi. The resulting map can be seen as an improved version of earlier such maps and is made publicly available, along with a map of its uncertainty. For the angular power spectrum we find a power law behavior Cl ∝ l-2.17 for a Faraday sky where an overall variance profile as a function of Galactic latitude has been removed, in agreement with earlier work. We show that this is in accordance with a 3D Fourier power spectrum P(k) ∝ k-2.17 of the underlying field neBr under simplifying geometrical and statistical assumptions.},

@article{Pelletier:2006aa,
	Abstract = {This paper investigates the nature of the MHD turbulence excited by the streaming of accelerated cosmic rays in a shock wave precursor. The two recognised regimes (non-resonant and resonant) of the streaming instability are taken into account. We show that the non-resonant instability is very efficient and saturates through a balance between its growth and non-linear transfer. The cosmic-ray resonant instability then takes over and is quenched by advection through the shock. The level of turbulence is determined by the non-resonant regime if the shock velocity V_sh is larger than a few times xi_CR c, where xi_CR is the ratio of the cosmic-ray pressure to the shock kinetic energy. The instability determines the dependence of the spectrum with respect to k_|| (wavenumbers along the shock normal). The transverse cascade of Alfv{\'e}n waves simultaneously determines the dependence in k⊥. We also study the redistribution of turbulent energy between forward and backward waves, which occurs through the interaction of two Alfv{\'e}n and one slow magneto-sonic wave. Eventually the spectra at the longest wavelengths are found almost proportional to k||-1. Downstream, anisotropy is further enhanced through the compression at shock crossing.},

	Abstract = {The central idea of diffusive shock acceleration is presented from microscopic and macroscopic viewpoints; applied to reactionless test particles in a steady plane shock the mechanism is shown to produce a power law spectrum in momentum with a slope which, to lowest order in the ratio of plasma to particle speed, depends only on the compression in the shock. The associated time scale is found (also by a macroscopic and a microscopic method) and the problems of spherical shocks, as exemplified by a point explosion and a stellar-wind terminator, are treated by singular perturbation theory. The effect of including the particle reaction is then studied. It is shown that if the scattering is due to resonant waves these can rapidly grow with unknown consequences. The possible steady modified shock structures are classified and generalised Rankine-Hugoniot conditions found. Modifications of the spectrum are discussed on the basis of an exact, if rather artificial, solution, a high-energy asymptotic expansion and a perturbation expansion due to Blandford. It is pointed out that no steady solution can exist for very strong shocks; the possible time dependence is briefly discussed.},

@article{Li:2001aa,
	Abstract = {We present a quantitative model for the infrared emission from dust in the diffuse interstellar medium. The model consists of a mixture of amorphous silicate grains and carbonaceous grains, each with a wide size distribution ranging from molecules containing tens of atoms to large grains >~1 mum in diameter. We assume that the carbonaceous grains have properties like polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) at very small sizes and graphitic properties for radii a>~50 {\AA}. On the basis of recent laboratory studies and guided by astronomical observations, we propose ``astronomical'' absorption cross sections for use in modeling neutral and ionized PAHs from the far-ultraviolet to the far-infrared. We also propose modifications to the far-infrared emissivity of ``astronomical silicate.'' We calculate energy distribution functions for small grains undergoing ``temperature spikes'' caused by stochastic absorption of starlight photons using realistic heat capacities and optical properties. Using a grain-size distribution consistent with the observed interstellar extinction, we are able to reproduce the near-IR to submillimeter emission spectrum of the diffuse interstellar medium, including the PAH emission features at 3.3, 6.2, 7.7, 8.6, and 11.3 mum. The model is compared with the observed emission at high Galactic latitudes as well as in the Galactic plane, as measured by the COBE/DIRBE, COBE/FIRAS, IRTS/MIRS, and IRTS/NIRS instruments. The model has 60×10-6 of C (relative to H) locked up in PAHs, with 45×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~6 {\AA} (NC~100 carbon atoms) to account for the PAH emission features and with 15×10-6 of C in a component peaking at ~50 {\AA} to account for the 60 mum flux. The total infrared emission is in excellent agreement with COBE/DIRBE observations at high Galactic latitudes, just as the albedo for our grain model is in accord with observations of the diffuse Galactic light. The aromatic absorption features at 3.3 and 6.2 mum predicted by our dust model are consistent with observations. We calculate infrared emission spectra for our dust model heated by a range of starlight intensities, from 0.3 to 104 times the local interstellar radiation field, and we tabulate the intensities integrated over the SIRTF/IRAC and MIPS bands. We also provide dust opacities tabulated from the extreme-ultraviolet to submillimeter wavelengths.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the processes occurring in the nuclear disk of our Galaxy is interesting in its own right, as part of the Milky Way, but also because it is the closest galactic nucleus. It has been more than two decades since the general phenomenon of higher gas temperature in the inner few hundred parsecs by comparison with local clouds in the disk of the Galaxy was recognized. This is one of the least understood characteristics of giant molecular clouds having a much higher gas temperature than dust temperature in the inner few degrees of the Galactic center. We propose that an enhanced flux of cosmic-ray electrons, as evidenced recently by a number of studies, is responsible for directly heating the gas clouds in the nuclear disk, elevating the temperature of molecular gas (~75 K) above the dust temperature (~20 K). In addition, we report the detection of nonthermal radio emission from Sgr B2 F based on low-frequency GMRT and VLA observations. The higher ionization fraction and thermal energy due to the impact of nonthermal electrons in star-forming sites have important implications in slowing down star formation in the nuclear disk of our Galaxy and nuclei of galaxies.},

At 90 cm the 'spiral' structure of the thermal source Sgr A West is clearly seen in absorption against the nonthermal emission of Sgr A East, showing conclusively that the former is in front of the latter. The entire shell of Sgr A East shows a low-frequency turnover corresponding to an optical depth of 1-2. This turnover corresponds to free-free absorption with an emission measure of about 100,000 pc/cm exp 6 if the electron temperature is about 5000 K. The approximately 7 arcmin halo surrounding Sgr A East and West also shows a low-frequency turnover. It is suggested that the halo contains a mixture of thermal and nonthermal gas and that the thermal component is responsible for the absorption extending across Sgr A East.},

	Abstract = {The high-energy activity in the inner few degrees of the Galactic center is traced by diffuse radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray emission. The physical relationship between different components of diffuse gas emitting at multiple wavelengths is a focus of this work. We first present radio continuum observations using the Green Bank Telescope and model the nonthermal spectrum in terms of a broken power-law distribution of ~GeV electrons emitting synchrotron radiation. We show that the emission detected by Fermi is primarily due to nonthermal bremsstrahlung produced by the population of synchrotron emitting electrons in the GeV energy range interacting with neutral gas. The extrapolation of the electron population measured from radio data to low and high energies can also explain the origin of Fe I 6.4 keV line and diffuse TeV emission, as observed with Suzaku, XMM-Newton, Chandra, and the H.E.S.S. observatories. The inferred physical quantities from modeling multiwavelength emission in the context of bremsstrahlung emission from the inner ~300 × 120 pc of the Galactic center are constrained to have the cosmic-ray ionization rate ~1-10 × 10-15 s-1, molecular gas heating rate elevating the gas temperature to 75-200 K, fractional ionization of molecular gas 10-6-10-5, large-scale magnetic field 10-20 muG, the density of diffuse and dense molecular gas ~100 and ~103 cm-3 over 300 pc and 50 pc path lengths, and the variability of Fe I Kalpha 6.4 keV line emission on yearly timescales. Important implications of our study are that GeV electrons emitting in radio can explain the GeV gamma-rays detected by Fermi and that the cosmic-ray irradiation model, like the model of the X-ray irradiation triggered by past activity of Sgr A*, can also explain the origin of the variable 6.4 keV emission from Galactic center molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {An analysis of continuum antenna temperatures observed in the GBT spectrometer bandpasses is presented for observations toward Sgr B2(N-LMH). Since 2004, we have identified four new prebiotic molecules toward this source by means of rotational transitions between low-energy levels; concurrently, we have observed significant continuum in GBT spectrometer bandpasses centered at 85 different frequencies in the range 1-48 GHz. The continuum heavily influences the molecular spectral features since we have observed far more absorption lines than emission lines for each of these new molecular species. Hence, it is important to understand the nature, distribution, and intensity of the underlying continuum in the GBT bandpasses for the purposes of radiative transfer, i.e., the means by which reliable molecular abundances are estimated. We find that the GBT spectrometer bandpass continuum is consistent with optically thin, nonthermal (synchrotron) emission with a flux density spectral index of -0.7 and a Gaussian source size of ~143" at 1 GHz that decreases with increasing frequency as nu-0.52. Some support for this model is provided by high-frequency VLA observations of Sgr B2.},

@article{Longmore:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The conversion of gas into stars is a fundamental process in astrophysics and cosmology. Stars are known to form from the gravitational collapse of dense clumps in interstellar molecular clouds, and it has been proposed that the resulting star formation rate is proportional to either the amount of mass above a threshold gas surface density, or the gas volume density. These star formation prescriptions appear to hold in nearby molecular clouds in our Milky Way Galaxy's disc as well as in distant galaxies where the star formation rates are often much larger. The inner 500 pc of our Galaxy, the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ), contains the largest concentration of dense, high-surface density molecular gas in the Milky Way, providing an environment where the validity of star formation prescriptions can be tested. Here, we show that by several measures, the current star formation rate in the CMZ is an order-of-magnitude lower than the rates predicted by the currently accepted prescriptions. In particular, the region 1$\,^{\circ}$ < l < 3$\,^{\circ}$.5, |b| < 0$\,^{\circ}$.5 contains ˜107 M&sun; of dense (> several 103 cm-3) molecular gas - enough to form 1000 Orion-like clusters - but the present-day star formation rate within this gas is only equivalent to that in Orion. In addition to density, another property of molecular clouds must be included in the star formation prescription to predict the star formation rate in a given mass of molecular gas. We discuss which physical mechanisms might be responsible for suppressing star formation in the CMZ.},

@article{Kruijssen:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The star formation rate (SFR) in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ, i.e. the central 500 pc) of the Milky Way is lower by a factor of >=10 than expected for the substantial amount of dense gas it contains, which challenges current star formation theories. In this paper, we quantify which physical mechanisms could be responsible. On scales larger than the disc scaleheight, the low SFR is found to be consistent with episodic star formation due to secular instabilities or possibly variations of the gas inflow along the Galactic bar. The CMZ is marginally Toomre-stable when including gas and stars, but highly Toomre-stable when only accounting for the gas, indicating a low condensation rate of self-gravitating clouds. On small scales, we find that the SFR in the CMZ may be caused by an elevated critical density for star formation due to the high turbulent pressure. The existence of a universal density threshold for star formation is ruled out. The H I-H2 phase transition of hydrogen, the tidal field, a possible underproduction of massive stars due to a bottom-heavy initial mass function, magnetic fields, and cosmic ray or radiation pressure feedback also cannot individually explain the low SFR. We propose a self-consistent cycle of star formation in the CMZ, in which the effects of several different processes combine to inhibit star formation. The rate-limiting factor is the slow evolution of the gas towards collapse - once star formation is initiated it proceeds at a normal rate. The ubiquity of star formation inhibitors suggests that a lowered central SFR should be a common phenomenon in other galaxies. We discuss the implications for galactic-scale star formation and supermassive black hole growth, and relate our results to the star formation conditions in other extreme environments.},

	Abstract = {The designation ``ultracompact HII region'' first appeared in the astronomical literature over 30 years ago. Since that time, of order 103 actual or candidate ultracompact (UC) HII regions have been identified, and no fewer than seven theoretical models have been proposed to describe them. Here we discuss recent observational evidence that suggests that the conventional ``UC HII'' classification may not be adequate to describe all of the small, dense nebulae surrounding young, massive stars. In particular, it appears that some UC HII regions may be small, high density regions that are integral parts of much larger structures; these we call ``UC HII regions with extended emission''. Other HII regions appear to be an order of magnitude smaller and two orders of magnitude denser than traditional UC HII regions, and hence are deserving of a new classification. We designate these as ``hypercompact HII regions.'' We provide brief scientific and historical perspectives and present the new observational data and arguments for the new classifications. We conclude with a short discussion of the method of spectral index analysis and its application to the study of density structure within HII regions.},

	Abstract = {The highly elliptical, 16-year-period orbit of the star S2 around the massive black hole candidate Sgr A* is a sensitive probe of the gravitational field in the Galactic centre. Near pericentre at 120 AU ≈ 1400 Schwarzschild radii, the star has an orbital speed of ≈7650 km s-1, such that the first-order effects of Special and General Relativity have now become detectable with current capabilities. Over the past 26 years, we have monitored the radial velocity and motion on the sky of S2, mainly with the SINFONI and NACO adaptive optics instruments on the ESO Very Large Telescope, and since 2016 and leading up to the pericentre approach in May 2018, with the four-telescope interferometric beam-combiner instrument GRAVITY. From data up to and including pericentre, we robustly detect the combined gravitational redshift and relativistic transverse Doppler effect for S2 of z = Deltalambda / lambda ≈ 200 km s-1/c with different statistical analysis methods. When parameterising the post-Newtonian contribution from these effects by a factor f , with f = 0 and f = 1 corresponding to the Newtonian and general relativistic limits, respectively, we find from posterior fitting with different weighting schemes f = 0.90 $\pm$ 0.09|stat $\pm$ 0.15|sys. The S2 data are inconsistent with pure Newtonian dynamics.  This paper is dedicated to Tal Alexander, who passed away about a week before the pericentre approach of S2.},

@article{Kiminki:2017aa,
	Abstract = {We constrain the proper motions of five OB stars associated with candidate stellar wind bow shocks in the Carina Nebula using Hubble Space Telescope ACS imaging over 9-10 yr baselines. These proper motions allow us to directly compare each star's motion to the orientation of its candidate bow shock. Although these stars are saturated in our imaging, we assess their motion by the shifts required to minimize residuals in their airy rings. The results limit the direction of each star's motion to sectors less than 90$\,^{\circ}$ wide. None of the five stars are moving away from the Carina Nebula's central clusters as runaway stars would be, confirming that a candidate bow shock is not necessarily indicative of a runaway star. Two of the five stars are moving tangentially relative to the orientation of their candidate bow shocks, both of which point at the OB cluster Trumpler 14. In these cases, the large-scale flow of the interstellar medium, powered by feedback from the cluster, appears to dominate over the motion of the star in producing the observed candidate bow shock. The remaining three stars all have some component of motion towards the central clusters, meaning that we cannot distinguish whether their candidate bow shocks are indicators of stellar motion, of the flow of ambient gas or of density gradients in their surroundings. In addition, these stars' lack of outward motion hints that the distributed massive-star population in Carina's South Pillars region formed in place, rather than migrating out from the association's central clusters.},

@article{Pereira:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Runaway O- and early B-type stars passing through the interstellar medium at supersonic velocities and characterized by strong stellar winds may produce bow shocks that can serve as particle acceleration sites. Previous theoretical models predict the production of high-energy photons by nonthermal radiative processes, but their efficiency is still debated.  Aims: We aim to test and explain the possibility of emission from the bow shocks formed by runaway stars traveling through the interstellar medium by using previous theoretical models.  Methods: We applied our model to AE Aurigae, the first reported star with an X-ray detected bow shock, to BD+43 3654, in which the observations failed in detecting high-energy emission, and to the transition phase of a supergiant star in the late stages of its life.  Results: From our analysis, we confirm that the X-ray emission from the bow shock produced by AE Aurigae can be explained by inverse Compton processes involving the infrared photons of the heated dust. We also predict low high-energy flux emission from the bow shock produced by BD+43 3654, and the possibility of high-energy emission from the bow shock formed by a supergiant star during the transition phase from blue to red supergiant.  Conclusions: Bow shocks formed by different types of runaway stars are revealed as a new possible source of high-energy photons in our neighborhood.},

Combining this with the optical, infrared, and submillimetre data, we analyse the large-scale diffuse radio emission associated with the region that exhibits a broken shell morphology. The spectral index of the emission in the shell is -0.8, indicating non-thermal emission. H alpha emission that mimics the morphology of the radio shell on a smaller scale is also detected here. Based on the non-thermal emission from the radio shell and the presence of its optical counterpart, we classify G351.7-1.2 as a candidate supernova remnant (SNR). A gamma-ray source detected by Fermi LAT (1FGLJ1729.1-3641c) is located towards the south-west of the radio shell and could have a possible origin in the interaction between high-velocity particles from the SNR and the ambient molecular cloud.},

	Abstract = {We present multifrequency, matching-beam, VLA radio continuum observations of the Cep A East radio source, known to consist of 16 compact ( 1") components clustered within a 25" radius region, most of which are aligned in stringlike structures. We find that the spectral indices of the emission from these compact objects, in the frequency interval from 1.5 to 15 GHz, cover a wide range, from -0.6 to 0.7. Positive spectral indices are exhibited by sources 2, 3b, 3c, and 3d. The first and last of these objects, the brightest sources within Cep A East, exhibit in addition elongated morphologies and angular-size and flux-density dependences with frequency that suggest they correspond to confined jets of ionized gas. Most of the objects that appear in string structures exhibit a mixture of flat and negative spectral indices across their faces, which indicates the presence of both thermal and nonthermal emission. The spectral indices of the integrated emission from sources 1b, 4, 6, and 7a are in the range between - 0.3 and -0.1 while those of sources 1 a, 5, 7b, and 7c are even more negative (-0.6 < alpha < -0.4). We suggest that the radio emission from the string sources arises in shocks resulting from the interaction of confined stellar winds with the surrounding medium. The duality in emission mechanisms is expected in shock waves where a small fraction of the electrons are accelerated to relativistic velocities, giving rise to nonthermal emission, while most of the electrons produce thermal free-free emission. We find that the nonthermal emission dominates the thermal emission when the density of the thermal electrons is below a critical density of 5 x 103 cm -3. We also observed the Cep A West radio source, which consists of two compact components and an elongated, diffuse, champagne-like structure. We find that the spectral index between 1.5 and 5 GHz of the peak and of the integrated emission from the latter component are -0.1 and -0.4, respectively. We suggest that the radio emission from the diffuse source arises from shocked gas at the edge of a cavity driven by a wind that originates from the brightest compact radio object within this region, which shows a spectral index at the peak of the emission of 0.6.},

The largest field covers a region of 2 deg x 2 deg with a resolution of 10 arcmin, the smallest covers 3 arcmin x 3 arcmin field, centered on the peak, with a resolution of 0.1 arcsec. The lower resolution maps emphasize the extended emission of the diffuse ionized gas. As the resolution increases, the maps sample regions of higher emission measure. A detailed comparison with H-alpha images shows a very good match on all scale sizes. As the resolution becomes finer than 1 arcsec a completely new aspect of the radio emission appears: a new class of weak, small diameter sources of high surface brightness are found. Many of these features are associated with stars. Finally, a morphological comparison of the radio continuum emission with similar-scale maps of molecular and atomic emission is presented.},

	Abstract = {Results are presented of a multifrequency, multiconfiguration study of the continuum emission from the triple radio continuum source in Serpens, observed with Very Large Array of the NRAO, which was carried out to investigate the spectral indices of the multiple components in Serpens in detail, to study the morphological characteristics of this radio source, and to resolve the angular structure of its components. In addition, the position of the H2O maser, known to be near this radio source was measured using the same instrument. On the basis of these observations, the triple radio continuum source in Serpens is identified as a young radio jet, with a dynamical age of only about 60 years, emanating from the central component. This radio jet exhibits a one-sided morphology that is very similar to that observed in optical Herbig-Haro jets, suggesting that jets associated with young stellar objects are intrinsically unipolar within the dynamical ages of the main jets. It is proposed that the Serpens radio jet could be a proto-Herbig-Haro system in an early stage of evolution.},

	Abstract = {Photoionizing radiation and stellar winds from massive stars deposit energy and momentum into the interstellar medium (ISM). They might disperse the local ISM, change its turbulent multi-phase structure, and even regulate star formation. Ionizing radiation dominates the massive stars' energy output, but the relative effect of winds might change with stellar mass and the properties of the ambient ISM. We present simulations of the interaction of stellar winds and ionizing radiation of 12, 23, and 60 M&sun; stars within a cold neutral (CNM, n0 = 100 cm-3), warm neutral (WNM, n0 = 1, 10 cm-3), or warm ionized (WIM, n0 = 0.1 cm-3) medium. The FLASH simulations adopt the novel tree-based radiation transfer algorithm TREERAY. With the On-the-Spot approximation and a temperature-dependent recombination coefficient, it is coupled to a chemical network with radiative heating and cooling. In the homogeneous CNM, the total momentum injection ranges from 1.6 × 104 to 4 × 105 M&sun; km s-1 and is always dominated by the expansion of the ionized HII region. In the WIM, stellar winds dominate (2 × 102 to 5 × 103 M&sun; km s-1), while the input from radiation is small (˜ 102 M&sun; km s-1). The WNM (n0 = 1 cm-3) is a transition regime. Energetically, stellar winds couple more efficiently to the ISM (˜ 0.1 percent of wind luminosity) than radiation (< 0.001 percent of ionizing luminosity). For estimating the impact of massive stars, the strongly mass-dependent ratios of wind to ionizing luminosity and the properties of the ambient medium have to be considered.},

	Abstract = {We have modelled the evolution of cometary H II regions produced by zero-age main-sequence stars of O and B spectral types, which are driving strong winds and are born off-centre from spherically symmetric cores with power-law (alpha = 2) density slopes. A model parameter grid was produced that spans stellar mass, age and core density. Exploring this parameter space, we investigated limb-brightening, a feature commonly seen in cometary H II regions. We found that stars with mass M* >= 12 M&sun; produce this feature. Our models have a cavity bounded by a contact discontinuity separating hot shocked wind and ionized ambient gas that is similar in size to the surrounding H II region. Because of early pressure confinement, we did not see shocks outside of the contact discontinuity for stars with M* <= 40 M&sun;, but the cavities were found to continue to grow. The cavity size in each model plateaus as the H II region stagnates. The spectral energy distributions of our models are similar to those from identical stars evolving in uniform density fields. The turn-over frequency is slightly lower in our power-law models as a result of a higher proportion of low-density gas covered by the H II regions.},

@article{Arthur:2006aa,
	Abstract = {We present numerical radiation-hydrodynamic simulations of cometary H II regions for a number of champagne flow and bow shock models. For the champagne flow models we study smooth density distributions with both steep and shallow gradients. We also consider cases in which the ionizing star has a strong stellar wind and cases in which the star additionally has a proper motion within the ambient density gradient. We find that our champagne flow plus stellar wind models have limb-brightened morphologies and kinematics that can see the line-of-sight velocities change sign twice between the head and tail of the cometary H II region, with respect to the rest frame velocity. Our bow shock models show that pressure gradients across and within the shell are very important for the dynamics and that simple analytic models assuming thin shells in ram pressure balance are wholly inadequate for describing the shape and kinematics of these objects at early times in their evolution. The dynamics of the gas behind the shock in the neutral material ahead of the ionization front in both champagne flow and bow shock type cometary H II regions is also discussed. We present simulated emission-measure maps and long-slit spectra of our results. Our numerical models are not tailored to any particular object, but comparison with observations from the literature shows that, in particular, the models combining density gradients and stellar winds are able to account for both the morphology and general radial velocity behavior of several observed cometary H II regions, such as the well-studied object G29.96-0.02.},

@article{Strelnitski:1996aa,
	Abstract = {The discovery of the first high-gain hydrogen recombination line (HRL) maser in the millimeter/ submillimeter spectrum of the emission-line star MWC 349A requires an expansion of current paradigms about HRLs. In this paper we reexamine the problem of non-LTE populations in recombining hydrogen and specify the conditions necessary for high-gain masing and lasing in HRLs. To do so, we use the extensive new results on hydrogen level populations produced by Storey & Hummer and our calculations for the net (that is, line plus continuum) absorption coefficient for HRLs. We present results for the alpha- and beta-lines whose principal quantum numbers n are between five and 100, for gas whose electron number density 3 <= log Ne(cm-3) <= 11, at two electron temperatures, Te = 5000 and 10,000 K. We show that the unsaturated maser gain in an HRL is a sharp function of Ne, and thus to achieve high-gain masing, each line requires a sufficiently extended region over which the density is rather closely specified.  Saturation of masing recombination lines is a critical consideration. We derive a simple equation for estimating the degree of saturation from the observed flux density and the interferometric and/or model information about the amplification path length, avoiding the vague issue of the solid angle of masing. We also present a qualitative way to approach the effects of saturation on adjacent emission lines, although the detailed modeling is highly case-specific.  We draw attention to another non-LTE phenomenon active in hydrogen: the overcooling of populations. This occurs for HRLs with n ≲ 20, in gas where Ne ≲ 105 cm-3. Observationally, the HRL over- cooling might manifest itself as an anomalously weak emission recombination line, or as a "dasar," that is, an anomalously strong absorption line.  In the simplest case of a homogeneous H II region, the absorption can be observed on the proper free-free continuum of the region, if some conditions for the line or/and continuum optical depths are satisfied.  We briefly discuss the prospects of detecting hydrogen masers, lasers, and dasars in several classes of Galactic and extragalactic objects, including compact H II regions, Be or Wolf-Rayet stars, starburst galaxies, and active galactic nuclei.},

A point-source catalog of 1,065,565 objects is presented. The catalog includes magnitudes for the point sources at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, and 8.0 mum, as well as JHKs photometry from Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The point-source catalog is confusion limited with average limits of 12.4, 12.1, 11.7, and 11.2 mag for [3.6], [4.5], [5.8], and [8.0], respectively. We find that the confusion limits are spatially variable because of stellar surface density, background surface brightness level, and extinction variations across the survey region. The overall distribution of point-source density with Galactic latitude and longitude is essentially constant, but structure does appear when sources of different magnitude ranges are selected. Bright stars show a steep decreasing gradient with Galactic latitude and a slow decreasing gradient with Galactic longitude, with a peak at the position of the Galactic center. From IRAC color-magnitude and color-color diagrams, we conclude that most of the point sources in our catalog have IRAC magnitudes and colors characteristic of red giant and asymptotic giant branch (AGB) stars.},

	Abstract = {Context. Cosmic rays play an important role in dense molecular cores, affecting their thermal and dynamical evolution and initiating the chemistry. Several studies have shown that the formation of protostellar discs in collapsing clouds is severely hampered by the braking torque exerted by the entrained magnetic field on the infalling gas, as long as the field remains frozen to the gas.  Aims: In this paper we examine the possibility that the concentration and twisting of the field lines in the inner region of collapse can produce a significant reduction of the ionisation fraction.  Methods: To check whether the cosmic-ray ionisation rate can fall below the critical value required to maintain good coupling, we first study the propagation of cosmic rays in a model of a static magnetised cloud varying the relative strength of the toroidal/poloidal components and the mass-to-flux ratio. We then follow the path of cosmic rays using realistic magnetic field configurations generated by numerical simulations of a rotating collapsing core with different initial conditions.  Results: We find that an increment of the toroidal component of the magnetic field, or, in general, a more twisted configuration of the field lines, results in a decrease in the cosmic-ray flux. This is mainly due to the magnetic mirroring effect that is stronger where larger variations in the field direction are present. In particular, we find a decrease of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate below 10-18 s-1 in the central 300-400 AU, where density is higher than about 109 cm-3. This very low value of the ionisation rate is attained in the cases of intermediate and low magnetisation (mass-to-flux ratio lambda = 5 and 17, respectively) and for toroidal fields larger than about 40% of the total field.  Conclusions: Magnetic field effects can significantly reduce the ionisation fraction in collapsing clouds. We provide a handy fitting formula to compute approximately the attenuation of the cosmic-ray ionisation rate in a molecular cloud as a function of the density and the magnetic configuration.},

	Abstract = {Context: Low-energy cosmic rays are a fundamental source of ionization for molecular clouds, influencing their chemical, thermal, and dynamical evolution.  Aims: The purpose of this work is to explore the possibility that a low-energy component of cosmic rays, not directly measurable from the Earth, can account for the discrepancy between the ionization rate measured in diffuse and dense interstellar clouds.  Methods: We collected the most recent experimental and theoretical data on the cross sections for the production of H2+ and He+ by electron and proton impact and discuss the available constraints on the cosmic-ray fluxes in the local interstellar medium. Starting from different extrapolations at low energies of the demodulated cosmic-ray proton and electron spectra, we computed the propagated spectra in molecular clouds in the continuous slowing-down approximation taking all the relevant energy loss processes into account.  Results: The theoretical value of the cosmic-ray ionization rate as a function of the column density of traversed matter agrees with the observational data only if the flux of either cosmic-ray electrons or of protons increases at low energies. The most successful models are characterized by a significant (or even dominant) contribution of the electron component to the ionization rate, in agreement with previous suggestions. However, the large spread of cosmic-ray ionization rates inferred from chemical models of molecular cloud cores remains to be explained.  Conclusions: Available data combined with simple propagation models support the existence of a low-energy component (below ~100 MeV) of cosmic-ray electrons or protons responsible for the ionization of molecular cloud cores and dense protostellar envelopes.},

	Abstract = {A large grid of stellar models computed with the most recent radiative opacities by Iglesias et al. (1992) is presented. The evolutionary tracks have initial masses in the range 0.6 to 120 solar masses and extend from the ZAMS to the beginning of the thermally pulsing regime of the AGB for low and intermediate mass stars, and to the central C-ignition for higher masses. Two smaller samples of stellar models are also presented. The first deals with models of the same chemical composition and opacity but calculated with the classical scheme of mixing. They are meant to provide the necessary tool for discriminating among the two types of mixing. The other sample contains models of the same composition calculated with overshoot and classical radiative opacities by Huebner et al. (1977).},

	Abstract = {The local cosmic-ray (CR) spectra are calculated for typical characteristic regions of a cold, dense molecular cloud to investigate two mechanisms of dust charging that have, thus far, been neglected: the collection of suprathermal CR electrons and protons by grains and photoelectric emission from grains due to the UV radiation generated by CRs. These two mechanisms add to the conventional charging by ambient plasma, produced in the cloud by CRs. We show that the CR-induced photoemission can dramatically modify the charge distribution function for submicron grains. We demonstrate the importance of the obtained results for dust coagulation: while the charging by ambient plasma alone leads to a strong Coulomb repulsion between grains and inhibits their further coagulation, the combination with the photoemission provides optimum conditions for the growth of large dust aggregates in a certain region of the cloud, corresponding to the densities n({{{H}}}2) between ˜104 and ˜106 cm-3. The charging effect of CRs is of a generic nature, and is therefore expected to operate not only in dense molecular clouds but also in the upper layers and the outer parts of protoplanetary disks.},

	Abstract = {We present subarcsecond observations toward the massive star-forming region G75.78+0.34. We used the Very Large Array to study the centimeter continuum and H2O and CH3OH maser emission, and the Owens Valley Radio Observatory and Submillimeter Array to study the millimeter continuum and recombination lines (H40alpha and H30alpha). We found radio continuum emission at all wavelengths, coming from three components: (1) a cometary ultracompact (UC) H II region with an electron density ~3.7 × 104 cm-3, excited by a B0 type star, and with no associated dust emission; (2) an almost unresolved UCH II region (EAST), located ~6'' to the east of the cometary UCH II region, with an electron density ~1.3 × 105 cm-3, and associated with a compact dust clump detected at millimeter and mid-infrared wavelengths; and (3) a compact source (CORE), located ~2'' to the southwest of the cometary arc, with a flux density increasing with frequency, and embedded in a dust condensation of 30 M &sun;. The CORE source is resolved into two compact and unresolved sources which can be well fit by two homogeneous hypercompact H II regions each one photoionized by a B0.5 zero-age main sequence star, or by free-free radiation from shock-ionized gas resulting from the interaction of a jet/outflow system with the surrounding environment. The spatial distribution and kinematics of water masers close to the CORE-N and S sources, together with excess emission at 4.5 mum and the detected dust emission, suggest that the CORE source is a massive protostar driving a jet/outflow.},

	Abstract = {We present an analysis of simultaneous multifrequency measurements of the Galactic emission in the 1-10 GHz range with 18$\,^{\circ}$ angular resolution taken from a high-altitude site. Our data yield a determination of the synchrotron spectral index between 1.4 and 7.5 GHz of betasyn = 2.81 +/- 0.16. Combining our data with maps made by Haslam et al. and Reich & Reich, we find betasyn = 2.76 +/- 0.11 in the 0.4-7.5 GHz range. These results are in agreement with the few previously published measurements. The variation of betasyn with frequency based on our results and compared with other data found in the literature suggests a steepening of the synchrotron spectrum toward high frequencies, as expected from theory because of the steepening of the parent cosmic-ray electron energy spectrum. Comparison between the Haslam data and the 19 GHz map of Cottingham also indicates a spatial variation of the spectral index on large angular scales. Additional high-quality data are necessary to provide a serious study of these effects.},

The emission is dominated by the middle and northern compact sources, but the far-infrared radiation associated with the Northeast H II region L and from the southern H II region/molecular maser source H have been detected for the first time. The data, together with existing infrared measurements, indicate that the optical depth within Sgr B2(N) is significantly greater than that of Sgr B2(M) and that it has a noticeable effect for lambda = 800 microns or less. The envelope of Sgr B2(M) becomes optically thick for the radiation from Sgr B2(N), located within it, for wavelengths 100 microns or less. From radiative transfer modeling, a luminosity of 10 million solar is obtained for the middle source and 2 million solar for the northern source.},

	Abstract = {Understanding the role of magnetic fields in star-forming regions is of fundamental importance. In the near future, the exceptional sensitivity of the Square Kilometre Array (SKA) will offer a unique opportunity to evaluate the magnetic field strength in molecular clouds and cloud cores through synchrotron emission observations. The most recent Voyager 1 data, together with Galactic synchrotron emission and Alpha Magnetic Spectrometer data, constrain the flux of interstellar cosmic-ray electrons between ˜3 MeV and ˜832 GeV, in particular in the energy range relevant for synchrotron emission in molecular cloud cores at SKA frequencies. Synchrotron radiation is entirely due to primary cosmic-ray electrons, the relativistic flux of secondary leptons being completely negligible. We explore the capability of SKA in detecting synchrotron emission in two starless molecular cloud cores in the southern hemisphere, B68 and FeSt 1-457, and we find that it will be possible to reach signal-to-noise ratios of the order of 2 - 23 at the lowest frequencies observable by SKA (60 - 218 MHz) with one hour of integration.},

	Abstract = {Context. Small amounts of atomic hydrogen, detected as absorption dips in the 21 cm line spectrum, are a well-known characteristic of dark clouds. The abundance of hydrogen atoms measured in the densest regions of molecular clouds can only be explained by the dissociation of H2 by cosmic rays.  Aims: We wish to assess the role of Galactic cosmic rays in the formation of atomic hydrogen, for which we use recent developments in the characterisation of the low-energy spectra of cosmic rays and advances in the modelling of their propagation in molecular clouds.  Methods: We modelled the attenuation of the interstellar cosmic rays that enter a cloud and computed the dissociation rate of molecular hydrogen that is due to collisions with cosmic-ray protons and electrons as well as fast hydrogen atoms. We compared our results with the available observations.  Results: The cosmic-ray dissociation rate is entirely determined by secondary electrons produced in primary ionisation collisions. These secondary particles constitute the only source of atomic hydrogen at column densities above  1021 cm-2. We also find that the dissociation rate decreases with column density, while the ratio between the dissociation and ionisation rates varies between about 0.6 and 0.7. From comparison with observations, we conclude that a relatively flat spectrum of interstellar cosmic-ray protons, such as suggested by the most recent Voyager 1 data, can only provide a lower bound for the observed atomic hydrogen fraction. An enhanced spectrum of low-energy protons is needed to explain most of the observations.  Conclusions: Our findings show that a careful description of molecular hydrogen dissociation by cosmic rays can explain the abundance of atomic hydrogen in dark clouds. An accurate characterisation of this process at high densities is crucial for understanding the chemical evolution of star-forming regions.},

	Abstract = {Context. Galactic cosmic rays (CRs) are a ubiquitous source of ionisation of the interstellar gas, competing with UV and X-ray photons as well as natural radioactivity in determining the fractional abundance of electrons, ions, and charged dust grains in molecular clouds and circumstellar discs.  Aims: We model the propagation of various components of Galactic CRs versus the column density of the gas. Our study is focussed on the propagation at high densities, above a few g cm-2, especially relevant for the inner regions of collapsing clouds and circumstellar discs.  Methods: The propagation of primary and secondary CR particles (protons and heavier nuclei, electrons, positrons, and photons) is computed in the continuous slowing down approximation, diffusion approximation, or catastrophic approximation by adopting a matching procedure for the various transport regimes. A choice of the proper regime depends on the nature of the dominant loss process modelled as continuous or catastrophic.  Results: The CR ionisation rate is determined by CR protons and their secondary electrons below ≈130 g cm-2 and by electron-positron pairs created by photon decay above ≈600 g cm-2. We show that a proper description of the particle transport is essential to compute the ionisation rate in the latter case, since the electron and positron differential fluxes depend sensitively on the fluxes of both protons and photons.  Conclusions: Our results show that the CR ionisation rate in high-density environments, such as the inner parts of collapsing molecular clouds or the mid-plane of circumstellar discs, is higher than previously assumed. It does not decline exponentially with increasing column density, but follows a more complex behaviour because of the interplay of the different processes governing the generation and propagation of secondary particles.},

	Abstract = {Type Ia supernovae (SNe) are presumed to arise from white dwarf progenitors, which may not appreciably modify their ambient medium. We study the interaction of the resulting supernova remnants with a constant density interstellar medium. Density profiles obtained from detailed explosion models of Type Ia SN explosions can be complex, but an exponential profile gives the best approximate representation of a set of profiles, and we emphasize this case. We describe the time evolution of dynamical quantities (such as radius, velocity, and expansion parameter) as a result of the interaction in terms of dimensionless variables and present the profiles of physical quantities. We compare our results to the power-law and constant ejecta density cases; a characteristic feature of the exponential case is that the shocked ejecta have a relatively constant temperature. The effect of a possible circumstellar wind region close to the supernova is to create a dense, cool shell near the contact discontinuity between the shocked ejecta and the surrounding medium. The complex density structure found in some supernova models persists in the shocked layer, giving rise to density and temperature variations. We apply our results to the two likely historical Type Ia SNe, SN 1006 and Tycho. The observed angular sizes and expansion rates are consistent with a distance of 1.95 +/- 0.4 kpc and an ambient H density of 0.05-0.1 cm-3 for SN 1006. For Tycho's SNR, the results are not conclusive but indicate a distance around 2.3 kpc for an ambient density of 0.6-1.1 cm-3. In both cases, the low expansion rate limits the extent of a possible circumstellar wind region. The evidence for temperature variations in the ejecta of Tycho's remnant suggests that the supernova profile was more complex than an exponential profile and contained density inhomogeneities, or that there was early interaction with a circumstellar wind.},

	Abstract = {The time-dependent nonlinear kinetic theory for cosmic ray (CR) acceleration in supernova remnants (SNRs) is applied studying the properties of the synchrotron emission from SNRs, in particular, the surface brightness-diameter (Sigma-D) relation. Detailed numerical calculations are performed for the expected range of the relevant physical parameters, namely the ambient density and the supernova explosion energy. The magnetic field in SNRs is assumed to be significantly amplified by the efficiently accelerating nuclear CR component. Due to the growing number of accelerated CRs the expected SNR luminosity increases during the free expansion phase, reaches a peak value at the beginning of the Sedov phase and then decreases again, since in this stage the overall CR number remains nearly constant, whereas the effective magnetic field diminishes with time. The theoretically predicted brightness-diameter relation in the radio range in the Sedov phase is close to SigmaR∝ D-17/4. It fits the observational data in a very satisfactory way. The observed spread of SigmaR at a given SNR size D is the result of the spread of supernova explosion energies and interstellar medium densities.

	Abstract = {More than 100 galaxy-scale strong gravitational lens systems have been found by searching for the emission lines coming from galaxies with redshifts higher than the lens galaxies. Based on this spectroscopic-selection method, we introduce the deep Residual Networks (ResNet; a kind of deep Convolutional Neural Networks) to search for the galaxy-Ly alpha emitter (LAE) lens candidates by recognizing the Ly alpha emission lines coming from high- redshift galaxies (2 < z < 3) in the spectra of early-type galaxies (ETGs) at middle redshift (z ˜ 0.5). The spectra of the ETGs come from the Data Release 12 (DR12) of the Baryon Oscillation Spectroscopic Survey (BOSS) of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey III (SDSS-III). In this paper, we first build a 28 layers ResNet model, and then artificially synthesize 150 000 training spectra, including 140 000 spectra without Ly alpha lines and 10 000 ones with Ly alpha lines, to train the networks. After 20 training epochs, we obtain a near-perfect test accuracy at 0.995 4. The corresponding loss is 0.002 8 and the completeness is 93.6 per cent. We finally apply our ResNet model to our predictive data with 174 known lens candidates. We obtain 1232 hits including 161 of the 174 known candidates (92.5 per cent discovery rate). Apart from the hits found in other works, our ResNet model also find 536 new hits. We then perform several subsequent selections on these 536 hits and present five most believable lens candidates.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) have central stellar mass surface densities exceeding 104 M&sun; pc-2. It is currently unknown whether the stars formed at such high (proto)stellar densities. We compile a sample of gas clouds in the Galaxy which have sufficient gas mass within a radius of a few parsecs to form a YMC, and compare their radial gas mass distributions to the stellar mass distribution of Galactic YMCs. We find that the gas in the progenitor clouds is distributed differently than the stars in YMCs. The mass surface density profiles of the gas clouds are generally shallower than the stellar mass surface density profiles of the YMCs, which are characterized by prominent dense core regions with radii ˜0.1 pc, followed by a power-law tail. On the scale of YMC core radii, we find that there are no known clouds with significantly more mass in their central regions when compared to Galactic YMCs. Additionally, we find that models in which stars form from very dense initial conditions require surface densities that are generally higher than those seen in the known candidate YMC progenitor clouds. Our results show that the quiescent, less evolved clouds contain less mass in their central regions than in the highly star-forming clouds. This suggests an evolutionary trend in which clouds continue to accumulate mass towards their centres after the onset of star formation. We conclude that a conveyor-belt scenario for YMC formation is consistent with the current sample of Galactic YMCs and their progenitor clouds.},

	Abstract = {Observable radio recombination lines can be produced by ionized gas in the vicinity of radio quasars through stimulation by the radio source. These same stimulated processes will alter the level populations of the highly excited levels which produce the radio recombination lines. The populations of highly excited levels in hydrogenic ions have been calculated in the presence of a strong, nonthermal (power-law spectrum) radiation field. An extensive grid of models is given for a range of values of the radio intensity and spectral index, and of the electron temperature and density in the ionized gas. The effect of low-frequency cutoffs in the spectrum of the radio source is considered. It is shown that in the limit where the radiation field becomes extremely strong, very weak absorption lines are produced. Stimulated transitions will also broaden the radio recombination lines; the widths and profiles of recombination lines produced through stimulation in quasars are calculated. The line strengths are calculated for the grid of models, and a procedure for deriving the parameters of the models from optical and radio observations of a quasar is briefly outlined.},

	Abstract = {Prospects for the detection of extragalactic radio recombination lines are considered, and criteria for detectability in individual cases are developed. It is shown that any radio recombination line emission from normal galaxies is primarily spontaneous and should be detectable at levels of about 1 to 10 mJy only from relatively nearby systems (out to about 5 to 10 Mpc). However, for radio galaxies and quasars, radio recombination lines are found to be produced mainly by stimulated emission and should therefore be detectable at the 1-mJy level out to cosmological distances. It is suggested that the best sources of radio recombination lines will be broad-line radio galaxies, particularly their narrow-line regions, and that the best frequency will generally be in the range from 1 to 10 GHz. It is noted that the absorption-line regions in front of radio galaxies and quasars might produce detectable stimulated radio recombination lines of carbon in the range from 0.1 to 1 GHz.},

	Abstract = {Calculations show that ortho-H2 and para-H2 exhibit different propensity rules in collisions with NH3. In particular, para-H2 tends to preferentially excite the upper (3 3 - ) component of the (j, k) = (3, 3) inversion doublet. Assuming collisional excitation, the existence of a maser in this transition within a molecular cloud implies an upper limit to the ratio of densities, n(o-H2)/n(p-H2). As this density ratio evolves (chemically) with time, to its upper limit there corresponds a lower limit to the age of the cloud. Calculations of the time-dependence of n(o-H2)/n(p-H2) enable this interstellar chronometer to be calibrated.},

Catalogs of compact and filamentary structures are given and compared to previous surveys of the region. Eight of the unusual nonthermal radio filaments are detected in 6 cm polarized emission; three of these are the first such detections, confirming their nonthermal nature. This survey found emission from a filament at (l,b) = (359.1,0.75) , or a projected distance from Sgr A* of 200 pc, greatly extending the latitude range observed with such features. There is also new evidence for spatial gradients in the 6/20 cm spectral indices of some filaments, and we discuss models for these gradients. In studying compact sources, the combination of spectral index and polarization information allows us to identify pulsar candidates and compact H II regions in the survey. There is also some evidence that the flux measurements of compact sources may be affected by electron scattering from the interstellar medium in the central few hundred parsecs of the Galaxy.},

Here, we present Very Large Array and GMRT observations with respective resolutions of ≈ 3\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 5× 1\buildrel{\prime\prime}\over{.} 2 and 25\prime\prime × 25\prime\prime  and report the detection of an OH(1720 MHz) maser, with no accompanying OH 1665, 1667, and 1612 MHz maser emission. The maser coincides with a 150 MHz nonthermal radio source in Sgr B2(M). This rare class of OH(1720 MHz) masers or the so-called supernova remnant (SNR) masers, with no main line transitions, trace shocked gas and signal the interaction of an expanding SNR with a molecular cloud. We interpret the 150 MHz radio source as either the site of a SNR-molecular gas interaction or a wind-wind collision in a massive binary system. The interaction of the molecular cloud and the nonthermal source enhances the cosmic-ray ionization rate, allows the diffusion of cosmic rays into the cloud, and produces the variable 6.4 keV line, GeV, and TeV gamma-ray emission from Sgr B2(M). The cosmic-ray electron interaction with the gas in the Galactic center can not only explain the measured high values of cosmic-ray ionization and heating rates but also contribute to nonthermal bremsstrahlung continuum emission, all of which are consistent with observations.},

One of the most important, but least understood, is the role of the magnetic fields. We discuss the possibility of using high-resolution, high-sensitivity radio observations to measure the in-situ synchrotron radiation from these molecular clouds. If the cosmic-ray particles penetrate clouds as expected, then we can measure the B-field strength directly using radio data. So far, this signature has never been detected from the collapsing clouds themselves and would be a unique probe of the magnetic field. Dense cores are typically ~0.05 pc in size, corresponding to ~arcsec at ~kpc distances, and flux density estimates are ~mJy at 1 GHz. They should be detectable, for example with the Square Kilometre Array.},

	Abstract = {High-resolution Very Large Array observations of the Arches cluster near the Galactic center show evidence of continuum emission at lambda=3.6, 6, 20, and 90 cm. The continuum emission at lambda=90 cm is particularly striking because thermal sources generally become optically thick at longer wavelengths and fall off in brightness, whereas nonthermal sources increase in brightness. It is argued that the radio emission from this unique source has compact and diffuse components produced by thermal and nonthermal processes, respectively. Compact sources within the cluster arise from stellar winds of mass-losing stars, whereas diffuse emission is likely to be due to colliding wind shocks of the cluster flow that generate relativistic particles that are due to diffuse shock acceleration. We also discuss the possibility that gamma-ray emission from 3EG J1746-2851, located within 3.3' of the Arches cluster, results from the inverse Compton scattering of the radiation field of the cluster.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiwavelength study of the filamentary infrared dark cloud (IRDC) G333.73+0.37. The region contains two distinct mid-infrared sources S1 and S2 connected by dark lanes of gas and dust. Cold dust emission from the IRDC is detected at seven wavelength bands, and we have identified 10 high-density clumps in the region. The physical properties of the clumps such as temperature (14.3--22.3 K) and mass (87--1530 M &sun;) are determined by fitting a modified blackbody to the spectral energy distribution of each clump between 160 mum and 1.2 mm. The total mass of the IRDC is estimated to be ~4700 M &sun;. The molecular line emission toward S1 reveals signatures of protostellar activity. Low-frequency radio emission at 1300 and 610 MHz is detected toward S1 (shell-like) and S2 (compact morphology), confirming the presence of newly formed massive stars in the IRDC. Photometric analysis of near- and mid-infrared point sources unveils the young stellar object population associated with the cloud. Fragmentation analysis indicates that the filament is supercritical. We observe a velocity gradient along the filament, which is likely to be associated with accretion flows within the filament rather than rotation. Based on various age estimates obtained for objects in different evolutionary stages, we attempt to set a limit to the current age of this cloud.},

	Abstract = {The deepest XMM-Newton mosaic map of the central 1.5 $\,^{\circ}$ of the Galaxy is presented, including a total of about 1.5 Ms of EPIC-pn cleaned exposures in the central 15 arcsec and about 200 ks outside. This compendium presents broad-band X-ray continuum maps, soft X-ray intensity maps, a decomposition into spectral components and a comparison of the X-ray maps with emission at other wavelengths. Newly discovered extended features, such as supernova remnants (SNRs), superbubbles and X-ray filaments are reported. We provide an atlas of extended features within $\pm$1$\,^{\circ}$ of Sgr A*. We discover the presence of a coherent X-ray-emitting region peaking around G0.1-0.1 and surrounded by the ring of cold, mid-IR-emitting material known from previous work as the `Radio Arc Bubble' and with the addition of the X-ray data now appears to be a candidate superbubble. Sgr A's bipolar lobes show sharp edges, suggesting that they could be the remnant, collimated by the circumnuclear disc, of an SN explosion that created the recently discovered magnetar, SGR J1745-2900. Soft X-ray features, most probably from SNRs, are observed to fill holes in the dust distribution, and to indicate a direct interaction between SN explosions and Galactic centre (GC) molecular clouds. We also discover warm plasma at high Galactic latitude, showing a sharp edge to its distribution that correlates with the location of known radio/mid-IR features such as the `GC Lobe'. These features might be associated with an inhomogeneous hot `atmosphere' over the GC, perhaps fed by continuous or episodic outflows of mass and energy from the GC region.},

	Abstract = {The inner degrees of the Galactic center contain a large population of filamentary structures observed at radio frequencies. These so-called non-thermal radio filaments (NRFs) trace magnetic field lines and have attracted significant interest due to their hard (Sv vpropnu-0.1 $\pm$ 0.4) synchrotron emission spectra. The origin of these filaments remains poorly understood. We show that the electrons and positrons created through the annihilations of a relatively light (~5-10 GeV) dark matter particle with the cross section predicted for a simple thermal relic can provide a compelling match to the intensity, spectral shape, and flux variation of the NRFs. Furthermore, the characteristics of the dark matter particle necessary to explain the synchrotron emission from the NRFs are consistent with those required to explain the excess gamma-ray emission observed from the Galactic center by the Fermi Large Area Telescope, as well as the direct detection signals observed by CoGeNT and DAMA/LIBRA.},

	Abstract = {We present 74 MHz radio continuum observations of the Galactic center region. These measurements show nonthermal radio emission arising from molecular clouds that is unaffected by free-free absorption along the line of sight. We focus on one cloud, G0.13-0.13, representative of the population of molecular clouds that are spatially correlated with steep spectrum (alpha327MHz74MHz = 1.3 $\pm$ 0.3) nonthermal emission from the Galactic center region. This cloud lies adjacent to the nonthermal radio filaments of the Arc near l - 0.2$\,^{\circ}$ and is a strong source of 74 MHz continuum, SiO (2-1), and Fe I Kalpha 6.4 keV line emission. This three-way correlation provides the most compelling evidence yet that relativistic electrons, here traced by 74 MHz emission, are physically associated with the G0.13-0.13 molecular cloud and that low-energy cosmic ray electrons are responsible for the Fe I Kalpha line emission. The high cosmic ray ionization rate -10-13 s-1 H-1 is responsible for heating the molecular gas to high temperatures and allows the disturbed gas to maintain a high-velocity dispersion. Large velocity gradient (LVG) modeling of multitransition SiO observations of this cloud implies H2 densities -104-5 cm-3 and high temperatures. The lower limit to the temperature of G0.13-0.13 is -100 K, whereas the upper limit is as high as 1000 K. Lastly, we used a time-dependent chemical model in which cosmic rays drive the chemistry of the gas to investigate for molecular line diagnostics of cosmic ray heating. When the cloud reaches chemical equilibrium, the abundance ratios of HCN/HNC and N2H+/HCO+ are consistent with measured values. In addition, significant abundance of SiO is predicted in the cosmic ray dominated region of the Galactic center. We discuss different possibilities to account for the origin of widespread SiO emission detected from Galactic center molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {Using the new wideband capabilities of the ATCA, we obtain spectra for PKS 1718-649, a well-known gigahertz-peaked spectrum radio source. The observations, between approximately 1 and 10 GHz over 3 epochs spanning approximately 21 months, reveal variability both above the spectral peak at ˜3 GHz and below the peak. The combination of the low- and high-frequency variability cannot be easily explained using a single absorption mechanism, such as free-free absorption or synchrotron self-absorption. We find that the PKS 1718-649 spectrum and its variability are best explained by variations in the free-free optical depth on our line of sight to the radio source at low frequencies (below the spectral peak) and the adiabatic expansion of the radio source itself at high frequencies (above the spectral peak). The optical depth variations are found to be plausible when X-ray continuum absorption variability seen in samples of active galactic nuclei is considered. We find that the cause of the peaked spectrum in PKS 1718-649 is most likely due to free-free absorption. In agreement with previous studies, we find that the spectrum at each epoch of observation is best fit by a free-free absorption model characterized by a power-law distribution of free-free absorbing clouds. This agreement is extended to frequencies below the 1 GHz lower limit of the ATCA by considering new observations with Parkes at 725 MHz and 199 MHz observations with the newly operational Murchison Widefield Array. These lower frequency observations argue against families of absorption models (both free-free and synchrotron self-absorption) that are based on simple homogenous structures.},

The luminosity of the smaller sources evolve strongly with the linear size. Optical depth effects have been included to the 3D model for the radio source of Kaiser to study the spectral turnover. Using this model, the observed trend can be explained by synchrotron self-absorption.

	Abstract = {We report on VLBI observations of a water maser source associated with the Sgr D H II region, which is a bright radio continuum source in the direction of the Galactic center region. The absolute proper motions and the distance measured by VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry (VERA) were (mualpha cos delta, mudelta) = (-1.32 $\pm$ 0.15 mas yr-1, -2.86 $\pm$ 0.34 mas yr-1) and d=2.36_{-0.39}^{+0.58} kpc, respectively. The line-of-sight velocity of the water maser emission is similar to that of the H91alpha recombination line emission detected at the Sgr D H II region. The spatial position and line-of-sight velocity of the water maser emission indicate that this source is physically associated with the extended H II source seen under radio continuum observations. Thus, our results suggest that the Sgr D H II region is located in the Scutum arm of the Galactic disk. We discuss this new view of the Sgr D complex, based on the parallax and proper motions.},

	Abstract = {Aims: The nonthermal radiative properties of 18 pulsar wind nebulae (PWNe) are studied in the 1D leptonic model.  Methods: The dynamical and radiative evolution of a PWN in a nonradiative supernova remnant are self-consistently investigated in this model. The leptons (electrons/positrons) are injected with a broken power-law form, and nonthermal emission from a PWN is mainly produced by time-dependent relativistic leptons through synchrotron radiation and inverse Compton process.  Results: Observed spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of all 18 PWNe are reproduced well, where the indexes of low-energy electron components lie in the range of 1.0-1.8 and those of high-energy electron components in the range of 2.1-3.1. Our results show that FX/Fgamma > 10 for young PWNe; 1 <FX/Fgamma <= 10 for evolved PWNe, except for G292.0+1.8; and FX/Fgamma <= 1 for mature/old PWNe, except for CTA 1. Moreover, most PWNe are particle-dominated. Statistical analysis for the sample of 14 PWNe further indicate that (1) not all pulsar parameters have correlations with electron injection parameters, but electron maximum energy and PWN magnetic field correlate with the magnetic field at the light cylinder, the potential difference at the polar cap, and the spin-down power; (2) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, bolometric, and synchrotron luminosities, but does not correlate with gamma-ray luminosity; (3) the spin-down power positively correlates with radio, X-ray, and gamma-band surface brightness; and (4) the PWN radius and the PWN age negatively correlate with X-ray luminosity, the ratio of X-ray to gamma-ray luminosities, and the synchrotron luminosity.},

@article{Henshaw:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Using spectral line observations of HNCO, N2H+, and HNC, we investigate the kinematics of dense gas in the central ˜250 pc of the Galaxy. We present SCOUSE (Semi-automated multi-COmponent Universal Spectral-line fitting Engine), a line-fitting algorithm designed to analyse large volumes of spectral line data efficiently and systematically. Unlike techniques which do not account for complex line profiles, SCOUSE accurately describes the {l, b, vLSR} distribution of Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) gas, which is asymmetric about Sgr A* in both position and velocity. Velocity dispersions range from 2.6 km s-1 < sigma < 53.1 km s-1. A median dispersion of 9.8 km s-1, translates to a Mach number, M_3D>=28. The gas is distributed throughout several `streams', with projected lengths ˜100-250 pc. We link the streams to individual clouds and sub-regions, including Sgr C, the 20 and 50 km s-1 clouds, the dust ridge, and Sgr B2. Shell-like emission features can be explained by the projection of independent molecular clouds in Sgr C and the newly identified conical profile of Sgr B2 in {l, b, vLSR} space. These features have previously invoked supernova-driven shells and cloud-cloud collisions as explanations. We instead caution against structure identification in velocity-integrated emission maps. Three geometries describing the 3D structure of the CMZ are investigated: (I) two spiral arms; (II) a closed elliptical orbit; (III) an open stream. While two spiral arms and an open stream qualitatively reproduce the gas distribution, the most recent parametrization of the closed elliptical orbit does not. Finally, we discuss how proper motion measurements of masers can distinguish between these geometries, and suggest that this effort should be focused on the 20 km s-1 and 50 km s-1 clouds and Sgr C.},

@article{Fontani:2017aa,
	Abstract = {The interstellar delivery of carbon atoms locked into molecules might be one of the key ingredients for the emergence of life. Cyanopolyynes are carbon chains delimited at their two extremities by an atom ofhydrogen and a cyano group, meaning that they could be excellent reservoirs of carbon. The simplest member, HC3N, is ubiquitous in the galactic interstellar medium and found also in external galaxies. Thus, understanding the growth of cyanopolyynes in regions forming stars similar to our Sun, and what affects them, is particularly relevant. In the framework of the IRAM/NOEMA Large Program SOLIS (Seeds Of Life In Space), we have obtained a map of two cyanopolyynes, HC3N and HC5N, in the protocluster OMC-2 FIR4. Because our Sun is thought to be born in a rich cluster, OMC-2 FIR4 is one of the closest and best known representatives of the environment in which the Sun may have been born. We find a HC3N/HC5N abundance ratio across the source in the range  1-30, with the smallest values (<=10) in FIR5 and in the eastern region of FIR4. The ratios <=10 can be reproduced by chemical models only if: (1) the cosmic-ray ionisation rate zeta is   4 × 10-14 s-1; (2) the gaseous elemental ratio C/O is close to unity; and (3) oxygen and carbon are largely depleted. The large zeta is comparable to that measured in FIR4 by previous works and was interpreted as due to a flux of energetic (>=10 MeV) particles from embedded sources. We suggest that these sources could lie east of FIR4 and FIR5. A temperature gradient across FIR4, with T decreasing from east to west by about 10 K, could also explain the observed change in the HC3N/HC5N line ratio, without the need of a cosmic ray ionisation rate gradient. However, even in this case, a high constant cosmic-ray ionisation rate (of the order of 10-14 s-1) is necessary to reproduce the observations.

@article{Bolatto:2013aa,
	Abstract = {The under-abundance of very massive galaxies in the Universe is frequently attributed to the effect of galactic winds. Although ionized galactic winds are readily observable, most of the expelled mass (that is, the total mass flowing out from the nuclear region) is likely to be in atomic and molecular phases that are cooler than the ionized phases. Expanding molecular shells observed in starburst systems such as NGC 253 (ref. 12) and M 82 (refs 13, 14) may facilitate the entrainment of molecular gas in the wind. Although shell properties are well constrained, determining the amount of outflowing gas emerging from such shells and the connection between this gas and the ionized wind requires spatial resolution better than 100 parsecs coupled with sensitivity to a wide range of spatial scales, a combination hitherto not available. Here we report observations of NGC 253, a nearby starburst galaxy (distance ~ 3.4 megaparsecs) known to possess a wind, that trace the cool molecular wind at 50-parsec resolution. At this resolution, the extraplanar molecular gas closely tracks the Halpha filaments, and it appears to be connected to expanding molecular shells located in the starburst region. These observations allow us to determine that the molecular outflow rate is greater than 3 solar masses per year and probably about 9 solar masses per year. This implies a ratio of mass-outflow rate to star-formation rate of at least 1, and probably ~3, indicating that the starburst-driven wind limits the star-formation activity and the final stellar content.},

	Abstract = {We present high-resolution images of the (13)CO(J = 1 to 0) emission from the molecular cloud near the Sgr B2 star-forming complex taken with the Nobeyama 45 m telescope. The data, supplemented by the larger maps taken with the Bell Labs 7 m telescope by Bally et al., show three characteristic kinematical features; (1) a "Shell" of emission seen at VLSR = 20 to 40 km/sec, (2) close morphological correlation between a depression in emission or a 'Hole' at VLSR = 40 to 50 km/sec and a well-defined emission region or a 'Clump' at VLSR = 70 to 80 km/sec, and (3) a straight ridge of emission or an 'Edge' seen at VLSR = 50 to 70 km/sec. The appearance and relative location of the Shell, the Hole, and the Clump are similar to those associated with a cloud collision event visualized by numerical simulations. We propose a scenario in which a dense, massive (106 solar mass) cloud (Clump) approximately 10 pc in diameter has collided, at a relative velocity of approximately 30 km/sec, with the extended less dense gas of the molecular cloud complex in the Galactic center region, and has created a hole with a bow shock (Hole and Shell). In the course of this collision, dense and massive molecular cloud cores may have formed at the interface between the colliding clouds, and their collapse resulted in the current burst of massive star formation in the Sgr B2 complex. This is the clearest observed case of a collision event between giant molecular clouds that triggers intense formation of massive (O-ty pe) stars.},

	Abstract = {Aims: We study the 12C/13C isotopic ratio in the disk of the central molecular zone and in the halo to trace gas accretion toward the Galactic center region in the Milky Way.  Methods: Using the IRAM 30m telescope, we observed the J = 1-0 rotational transition of HCO+, HCN, HNC, and their 13C isotopic substitutions in order to measure the 12C/13C isotopic ratio. We observed 9 positions selected throughout the Galactic center region, including clouds at high latitude, locations where the X1 and X2 orbits associated with the barred potential are expected to intersect, and typical Galactic center molecular clouds.  Results: We find a systematically higher 12C/13C isotopic ratio (>40) toward the halo and the X1 orbits than for the Galactic center molecular clouds (20-25). Our results point to molecular gas that has undergone a different degree of nuclear processing than observed in the gas towards the inner Galactic center region.  Conclusions: The high isotopic ratios are consistent with the accretion of the gas from the halo and from the outskirts of the Galactic disk.  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30m telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).},

	Abstract = {The carbon isotopic ratio across the Galaxy was studied by observing nine interstellar clouds in the doubly rare isotope of carbon monoxide, C-13/O-18, and in the rare isotopic species C-12/O-18. The goal in this study was to improve the data from optically thin carbon monoxide emissions. A systematic gradient is found in the C-12/C-13 isotopic ratio across the Galaxy, ranging from about 30 in the inner part at 5 kpc to about 70 at 12 kpc, with a Galactic center value of 24. Near the solar radius the average ratio is 57, but it is somewhat larger, about 67, in Orion. Carbon monoxide isotopic ratios are smaller than those of formaldehyde, but they have roughly the same slope across the Galaxy. The result of 57 for the local CO ratio lies between the values from various CH(+) absorption measurements.},

	Abstract = {We have detected linear polarization in the 115 mum continuum radiation from the giant molecular cloud Sagittarius B2. We found polarization at nine positions in the dense cloud core and at 15 positions in the less-dense envelope. The polarization in the core is due to absorption by magnetically aligned grains and that in the envelope is due to emission from magnetically aligned grains. The inferred magnetic field direction is roughly north-south everywhere, but with spatially smooth variations of up to 30$\,^{\circ}$. By considering our data together with Zeeman splitting observations we are able to set a conservative lower limit of 150 muG on the strength of the large-scale field in the envelope. If large-scale fields this strong are common in Galactic center clouds, they could be detectable via large-beam Zeeman measurements. For positions in the envelope that are furthest from the core, the field is nearly parallel to the plane of the Galaxy. This is consistent with the idea of a globally azimuthal magnetic field in the Galactic center neutral gas layer, which is expected if gravitational forces dominate magnetic forces.},

@article{Crocker:2007aa,
	Abstract = {The H.E.S.S. instrument has observed a diffuse flux of ~TeV gamma-rays from a large solid angle around the Galactic center (GC). This emission is correlated with the distribution of gas in the region, suggesting that the gamma-rays originate in collisions between cosmic-ray hadrons (CRHs) and ambient matter. Of particular interest, H.E.S.S. has detected gamma-rays from the Sagittarius (Sgr) B molecular cloud complex. Prompted by the suggestion of a hadronic origin for the gamma-rays, we have examined archival 330 and 74 MHz Very Large Array radio data and 843 MHz Sydney University Molonglo Sky Survey data covering Sgr B, looking for synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons (expected to be created in the same interactions that supply the observed gamma-rays). Intriguingly, we have uncovered nonthermal emission, but at a level exceeding expectation. Adding to the overall picture, recent observations by the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment telescope show that the cosmic-ray ionization rate is 10 times greater in the Sgr B2 region of Sgr B than the local value. Lastly, Sgr B2 is also a very bright X-ray source. We examine scenarios for the spectra of CRHs and/or primary electrons that would reconcile all these different data. We determine that (1) a hard (~E-2.2), high-energy (>~TeV) population of CRHs is unavoidably required by the H.E.S.S. gamma-ray data, and (2) the remaining broadband, nonthermal phenomenology is explained either by a rather steep (~E-2.9) spectrum of primary electrons or a (~E-2.7) population of CRHs. Perhaps unsurprisingly, no single power-law population of either leptons or hadrons can explain the totality of broadband, nonthermal Sgr B phenomenology.},

	Abstract = {We present results from a high-resolution wide-field imaging observation of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) in H13CO+J = 1-0 and SiO v = 0, J = 2-1 emission lines using the 45-m telescope at the Nobeyama Radio Observatory in order to depict the high-density molecular gas mass distribution and explore molecular gas affected by interstellar shocks. By using the clumpfind algorithm we identify 114 molecular clumps in the H13CO+ data cube. The clump mass function (CMF) can be described by a power law (dN/dM ∝ M-gamma, with gamma ~= 2) in the range of 5 × 103 < Mclump < 2 × 104 M&sun;. The brightness temperature ratio RT = T(SiO)/T(H13CO+) indicates the strength of the shock. The Sgr B2 complex has several expanding shell-like structures with a large velocity-width (DeltaV > 50 km s-1). They correspond to the high brightness temperature ratio area (RT ≲ 8). A Large Velocity Gradient model analysis with the RADEX program confirms the enhancement of SiO molecules in the shells. On the other hand, there is no such large shell with a high ratio in the Sgr A complex. A hollow hemispherical structure is found in the l-b-v data cube of the Sgr B2 complex. The central part of the structure has a high ratio (RT ≲ 8). The ratio decreases with proximity to the outer area. The properties are consistent with those expected from simulations of cloud-cloud collisions. The structure is probably a site of ongoing cloud-cloud collision.},

	Abstract = {There is evidence that the young Sun emitted a high flux of energetic (>=10 MeV) particles. The collisions of these particles with the material at the inner edge of the Protosolar Nebula disk induced spallation reactions that formed short-lived radionuclei, like 10Be, whose trace is now visible in some meteorites. However, it is poorly known exactly when this happened, and whether and how it affected the solar system. Here, we present indirect evidence for an ejection of energetic particles in the young protostar, OMC-2 FIR 4, similar to that experienced by the young solar system. In this case, the energetic particles collide with the material in the protostellar envelope, enhancing the abundance of two molecular ions, HCO+ and N2H+, whose presence is detected via Herschel observations. The flux of energetic particles at a distance of 1 AU from the emitting source, estimated from the measured abundance ratio of HCO+ and N2H+, can easily account for the irradiation required by meteoritic observations. These new observations demonstrate that the ejection of >=10 MeV particles is a phenomenon occurring very early in the life of a protostar, before the disappearance of the envelope from which the future star accretes. The whole envelope is affected by the event, which sets constraints on the magnetic field geometry in the source and opens up the possibility that the spallation reactions are not limited to the inner edge of the Protosolar Nebula disk.},

	Abstract = {Context. During the formation of a star, material is ejected along powerful jets that impact the ambient material. This outflow regulates star formation by e.g. inducing turbulence and heating the surrounding gas. Understanding the associated shocks is therefore essential to the study of star formation.  Aims: We present comparisons of shock models with CO, H2, and SiO observations in a "pure" shock position in the BHR71 bipolar outflow. These comparisons provide an insight into the shock and pre-shock characteristics, and allow us to understand the energetic and chemical feedback of star formation on Galactic scales.  Methods: New CO (Jup = 16, 11, 7, 6, 4, 3) observations from the shocked regions with the SOFIA and APEX telescopes are presented and combined with earlier H2 and SiO data (from the Spitzer and APEX telescopes). The integrated intensities are compared to a grid of models that were obtained from a magneto-hydrodynamical shock code, which calculates the dynamical and chemical structure of these regions combined with a radiative transfer module based on the "large velocity gradient" approximation.  Results: The CO emission leads us to update the conclusions of our previous shock analysis: pre-shock densities of 104 cm-3 and shock velocities around 20-25 km s-1 are still constrained, but older ages are inferred (~4000 years).  Conclusions: We evaluate the contribution of shocks to the excitation of CO around forming stars. The SiO observations are compatible with a scenario where less than 4% of the pre-shock SiO belongs to the grain mantles. We infer outflow parameters: a mass of 1.8 × 10-2 M&sun; was measured in our beam, in which a momentum of 0.4 M&sun; km s-1 is dissipated, corresponding to an energy of 4.2 × 1043 erg. We analyse the energetics of the outflow species by species. Comparing our results with previous studies highlights their dependence on the method: H2 observations only are not sufficient to evaluate the mass of outflows.},

	Abstract = {Context: We study the production and emission of SiO and H_2 in the gas phase of molecular outflows, extending previous work in which we considered steady-state C-type shock waves and assumed the silicon to be present only in the cores of silicate grains.  Aims: We place constraints on the physical parameters of the pre-shock region, using recent observations of SiO and observations of molecular hydrogen. We show the effects of introducing SiO-containing mantles and of varying the age of the shock wave. We consider simultaneously the emission of SiO and H_2 from the young L1157 outflow.  Methods: The molecular outflows are studied by means of a code that can generate stationary C- and J-type shock models and approximate non-stationary solutions, which combine these two types of shock wave. The emission of molecular hydrogen is computed by this code, whereas the SiO emission is computed by means of a separate LVG model, which uses the calculated physical and chemical profiles. A grid of models has been computed, with shock speeds in the range 10 <= v_s <= 35 km s-1 and pre-shock gas densities 104 <= n_H <= 106 cm-3. A wide range of magnetic field strengths has been investigated, from 45 muG to about 600 muG.  Results: We illustrate our results by means of observational data obtained on the blue lobe of the L1157 outflow. Given the combinations of pre-shock densities and shock velocities necessary to fit the H_2 observations, we find that the erosion only of the silicate material in the grains cores cannot account for the observed SiO line intensities. We investigate the possiblity that a fraction of the SiO is present initially in the grain mantles, and we succeed in constraining this fraction. Introducing even a few percent of the silicon (as SiO) into the mantles is sufficient to increase the SiO line widths and fluxes by an order of magnitude. With this assumption, it is possible to find a non-stationary shock model that provides a reasonable fit of the observations of both H_2 and SiO. Conclusions: With a few percent of the silicon present initially in the grain mantles, good agreement is obtained with recent observations of SiO line integrated line intensities for a pre-shock density nH = 104 cm-3 and a shock speed vs = 20 km s-1. The magnetic field strength and the shock age are not well constrained by the observations of either H_2 or SiO. We show that CO observations (in particular, with the Herschel satellite) could provide further discrimination between the models.

	Abstract = {We have mapped the J = 1 --> 0 line of SiO in a 1$\,^{\circ}$ × 12' (l × b) region around the Galactic center (GC) with an angular resolution of 2' (~4 pc). In contrast to the spatial distribution of other high dipole moment molecules like CS, whose emission is nearly uniform, the SiO emission is very fragmented, and it is associated with some molecular clouds only. In particular, it is remarkable that the SiO emission follows closely the nonthermal radio arc in the GC. The SiO clouds are more extended than the beam, with typical sizes between 4 and 20 pc. High angular resolution (26") mapping in the J = 2 --> 1 line of SiO toward the molecular clouds in Sgr B2 and Sgr A shows that the SiO emission is relatively smooth, with structures of typically 2 pc. From the line intensities of the J = 2 --> 1, J = 3 --> 2, and J = 5 --> 4 transitions of SiO, we derive H2 densities for these clouds of a few 104 cm-3. The SiO fractional abundances are ~10-9 for the SiO clouds and <~10-10 for the other molecular clouds in the GC. The characteristics (size and H2 densities) of the SiO emission in the GC are completely different from those observed in the Galactic disk, where the SiO emission arises from much smaller regions with larger H2 densities. We discuss briefly the implications of the SiO emission in the molecular clouds of the GC. We conclude that the particular chemistry in these clouds is probably related to large-scale fast shocks occurring in the Galactic center region.},

	Abstract = {We have mapped 20 spectral lines in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ) around the Galactic Centre, emitting from 85.3 to 93.3 GHz. This work used the 22-m Mopra radio telescope in Australia, equipped with the 8-GHz bandwidth University of New South Wales-Mopra Spectrometer (UNSW-MOPS) digital filter bank, obtaining ˜2 km s-1 spectral and ˜40 arcsec spatial resolution. The lines measured include emission from the c-C3H2, CH3CCH, HOCO+, SO, H13CN, H13CO+, SO, H13NC, C2H, HNCO, HCN, HCO+, HNC, HC3N, 13CS and N2H+ molecules. The area covered is Galactic longitude -0?7 to 1?8 and latitude -0?3 to 0?2, including the bright dust cores around Sgr A, Sgr B2, Sgr C and G1.6-0.025. We present images from this study and conduct a principal component analysis on the integrated emission from the brightest eight lines. This is dominated by the first component, showing that the large-scale distribution of all molecules is very similar. We examine the line ratios and optical depths in selected apertures around the bright dust cores, as well as for the complete mapped region of the CMZ. We highlight the behaviour of the bright HCN, HNC and HCO+ line emission, together with that from the 13C isotopologues of these species, and compare the behaviour with that found in extragalactic sources where the emission is unresolved spatially. We also find that the isotopologue line ratios (e.g. HCO+/H13CO+) rise significantly with increasing redshifted velocity in some locations. Line luminosities are also calculated and compared to that of CO, as well as to line luminosities determined for external galaxies.},

	Abstract = {We report ALMA observations with resolution ≈0."5 at 3 mm of the extended Sgr B2 cloud in the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ). We detect 271 compact sources, most of which are smaller than 5000 au. By ruling out alternative possibilities, we conclude that these sources consist of a mix of hypercompact H II regions and young stellar objects (YSOs). Most of the newly detected sources are YSOs with gas envelopes that, based on their luminosities, must contain objects with stellar masses {M}* ≳ 8 {M}o . Their spatial distribution spread over a ~12 × 3 pc region demonstrates that Sgr B2 is experiencing an extended star formation event, not just an isolated ``starburst'' within the protocluster regions. Using this new sample, we examine star formation thresholds and surface density relations in Sgr B2. While all of the YSOs reside in regions of high column density (N({{{H}}}2)≳ 2× {10}23 {{cm}}-2), not all regions of high column density contain YSOs. The observed column density threshold for star formation is substantially higher than that in solar vicinity clouds, implying either that high-mass star formation requires a higher column density or that any star formation threshold in the CMZ must be higher than in nearby clouds. The relation between the surface density of gas and stars is incompatible with extrapolations from local clouds, and instead stellar densities in Sgr B2 follow a linear {{{Sigma }}}* {--}{{{Sigma }}}{gas} relation, shallower than that observed in local clouds. Together, these points suggest that a higher volume density threshold is required to explain star formation in CMZ clouds.},

The radio sources 3C123, 3C196, 3C286, and 3C295 are found to be varying at a level of less than ~5% per century at all frequencies between 1 and 50 GHz, and hence are suitable as flux density standards. We present polynomial expressions for their spectral flux densities, valid from 1 to 50 GHz, with absolute accuracy estimated at 1%-3% depending on frequency. Of the four sources, 3C286 is the most compact and has the flattest spectral index, making it the most suitable object on which to establish the spectral flux density scale. The sources 3C48, 3C138, 3C147, NGC 7027, NGC 6542, and MWC 349 show significant variability on various timescales. Polynomial coefficients for the spectral flux density are developed for 3C48, 3C138, and 3C147 for each of the 17 observation dates, spanning 1983-2012. The planets Venus, Uranus, and Neptune are included in our observations, and we derive their brightness temperatures over the same frequency range.},

	Abstract = {Synchrotron emission has recently been detected in the jet of a massive protostar, providing further evidence that certain jet formation characteristics for young stars are similar to those found for highly relativistic jets from active galactic nuclei. We present data at 325 and 610 MHz taken with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope of the young, low-mass star DG Tau, an analog of the Sun soon after its birth. This is the first investigation of a low-mass young stellar object at such low frequencies. We detect emission with a synchrotron spectral index in the proximity of the DG Tau jet and interpret this emission as a prominent bow shock associated with this outflow. This result provides tentative evidence for the acceleration of particles to relativistic energies due to the shock impact of this otherwise very low-power jet against the ambient medium. We calculate the equipartition magnetic field strength B min ≈ 0.11 mG and particle energy E min ≈ 4 × 1040 erg, which are the minimum requirements to account for the synchrotron emission of the DG Tau bow shock. These results suggest the possibility of low energy cosmic rays being generated by young Sun-like stars.},

@article{Padovani:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Galactic cosmic rays are particles presumably accelerated in supernova remnant shocks that propagate in the interstellar medium up to the densest parts of molecular clouds, losing energy and their ionisation efficiency because of the presence of magnetic fields and collisions with molecular hydrogen. Recent observations hint at high levels of ionisation and at the presence of synchrotron emission in protostellar systems, which leads to an apparent contradiction.  Aims: We want to explain the origin of these cosmic rays accelerated within young protostars as suggested by observations.  Methods: Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to have an efficient cosmic-ray acceleration through diffusive shock acceleration. We analyse three main acceleration sites (shocks in accretion flows, along the jets, and on protostellar surfaces), then we follow the propagation of these particles through the protostellar system up to the hot spot region.  Results: We find that jet shocks can be strong accelerators of cosmic-ray protons, which can be boosted up to relativistic energies. Other promising acceleration sites are protostellar surfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough to accelerate cosmic-ray protons. In contrast, accretion flow shocks are too weak to efficiently accelerate cosmic rays. Though cosmic-ray electrons are weakly accelerated, they can gain a strong boost to relativistic energies through re-acceleration in successive shocks.  Conclusions: We suggest a mechanism able to accelerate both cosmic-ray protons and electrons through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism, which can be used to explain the high ionisation rate and the synchrotron emission observed towards protostellar sources. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the ionisation of the protostellar disc, on the star and planet formation processes, and on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.},

	Abstract = {Context. The formation of protostellar discs is severely hampered by magnetic braking, as long as magnetic fields remain frozen in the gas. The latter condition depends on the levels of ionisation that characterise the innermost regions of a collapsing cloud.  Aims: The chemistry of dense cloud cores and, in particular, the ionisation fraction is largely controlled by cosmic rays. The aim of this paper is to evaluate whether the attenuation of the flux of cosmic rays expected in the regions around a forming protostar is sufficient to decouple the field from the gas, thereby influencing the formation of centrifugally supported disc.  Methods: We adopted the method developed in a former study to compute the attenuation of the cosmic-ray flux as a function of the column density and the field strength in clouds threaded by poloidal and toroidal magnetic fields. We applied this formalism to models of low- and high-mass star formation extracted from numerical simulations of gravitational collapse that include rotation and turbulence.  Results: For each model we determine the size of the magnetic decoupling zone, where collapse or rotation motion becomes unaffected by the local magnetic field. In general, we find that decoupling only occurs when the attenuation of cosmic rays is taken into account with respect to a calculation in which the cosmic-ray ionisation rate is kept constant. The extent of the decoupling zone also depends on the dust grain size distribution and is larger if large grains (of radius ~10-5 cm) are formed by compression and coagulation during cloud collapse. The decoupling region disappears for the high-mass case. This is due to magnetic field diffusion caused by turbulence that is not included in the low-mass models.  Conclusions: We conclude that a realistic treatment of cosmic-ray propagation and attenuation during cloud collapse may lead to a value of the resistivity of the gas in the innermost few hundred AU around a forming protostar that is higher than generally assumed. Forthcoming self-consistent calculations should investigate whether this effect is strong enough to effectively decouple the gas from the field and to compute the amount of angular momentum lost by infalling fluid particles when they enter the decoupling zone.

@article{Padovani:2015aa,
	Abstract = {The main signature of the interaction between cosmic rays and molecular clouds is the high ionisation degree. This decreases towards the densest parts of a cloud, where star formation is expected, because of energy losses and magnetic effects. However recent observations hint to high levels of ionisation in protostellar systems, therefore leading to an apparent contradiction that could be explained by the presence of energetic particles accelerated within young protostars. Our modelling consists of a set of conditions that has to be satisfied in order to provide an efficient particle acceleration through the diffusive shock acceleration mechanism. We find that jet shocks can be strong accelerators of protons which can be boosted up to relativistic energies. Another possibly efficient acceleration site is located at protostellar surfaces, where shocks caused by impacting material during the collapse phase are strong enough to accelerate protons. Our results demonstrate the possibility of accelerating particles during the early phase of a proto-Solar-like system and can be used as an argument to support available observations. The existence of an internal source of energetic particles can have a strong and unforeseen impact on the star and planet formation process as well as on the formation of pre-biotic molecules.},

In addition, data on most of the previously mapped blazars have been reprocessed in order to achieve higher dynamic range. Extended emission has been detected associated with 49 of the 54 objects. The extended radio emission has been used to test the hypothesis that blazars are normal radio galaxies and radio quasars viewed along the jet axes. It is found that blazars have substantial extended power, consistent with this hypothesis. The ratio of core to extended radio emission has been studied as a possible indicator of viewing aspect or beaming intensity.},

	Abstract = {(C-13)O and (C-18)O observations of the central region of Sagittarius B2 are presented. A (C-13)O to (C-18)O abundance ratio of 9.0 + or - 1.9, consistent with the average ratio in the disk and other Galactic center sources, is obtained. Comparison of the (C-13)O column density based on the present data with H2 column density based on 1300 micron continuum data gives an upper limit of 10 to the -6th for the (C-13)O fractional abundance, a factor of two lower than the local value. The (C-12)O/H2 abundance ratio is a factor of six lower than the local value due to the lower (C-12)O to (C-13)O ratio. It is concluded that abundances of many molecular species in addition to the CO isotopes may be lower than in local clouds. The observations suggest a two-component structure for the cloud, with a constant density component and a component with density having a power-law dependence on the distance from cloud center. Values for the outer radius, total mass, and virial mass of the cloud are derived.},

	Abstract = {The ionized gas in the Sagittarius B2 Main star-forming region has been imaged with ~65 mas (600 AU) resolution using the Very Large Array (VLA) at 7 mm in the A configuration. These observations have ~4-5 times the resolution of the previous highest resolution images of this source. These VLA observations show that the central four ultracompact H II (UC H II) regions in Sgr B2 Main (F1, F2, F3, and F4) break up into ~20 separate UC H II regions. The individual sources have small resolved sizes (~10-3 pc), high derived emission measures (EM ~ 109 pc cm-6), and high rms electron densities (ne ~ 106 cm-3). We compare the observed radius and derived emission measure of each of these regions with those expected for a UC H II region in pressure equilibrium with its environment, using previously published temperatures and densities for the Sgr B2 molecular core (nH2=2×107 cm-3). We find that the observed emission measures are in fact higher than those predicted in a simple pressure-confinement model, suggesting that the molecular densities on scales that confine the UC H II regions may be higher than 2 × 107 cm-3.},

We detected the v_7=1 state of cyanoacetylene toward all six regions and the v_6=1 line toward five of them. Toward G10.47+0.03, we detected lines from 11 different vibrationally excited states with excitation energies up to 1600 K above ground. Of these, six are first detections. We also have detected several transitions of (13) C substituted cyanoacetylene in the v6=1, v7=1, and v7=2 states and provide improved rest frequencies for several of these. The population distribution of the vibrationally excited HC_3{N} molecules is analyzed and it is concluded that our results are consistent with thermalised level populations at a temperature of 270 K. From the interferometer results we find the source of HC_3{N} emission to be coincident with NH3(4,4) and CH_3{CN} emission within the positional error of 1\arcsec.

For some complex organic molecules, we find rotation temperatures and column densities which are much higher than those found in earlier studies.

The 1.5"×1.4" VLA beam shows two principal sources of ethyl cyanide emission: an unresolved source ~5" north of the LMH that is kinematically consistent with simple expansion, contraction, or small-scale turbulence, and the resolved LMH core source itself that shows kinematics indicating an edge-on rotating disk that extends >=3" (~0.1 pc) in the approximate east-west direction. A search for the 707-606 rotational transition of the amino acid glycine (NH2CH2COOH) at 43.7 GHz toward Sgr B2(N-LMH) gave negative results.},

	Abstract = {Observations of two H2CO (303-202 and 321-220) lines and continuum emission at 1.3 mm toward Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) have been carried out with the SMA. The mosaic maps of Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) in both continuum and lines show a complex distribution of dust and molecular gas in both clumps and filaments surrounding the compact star formation cores. We have observed a decelerating outflow originated from the Sgr B2(M) core, showing that both the redshifted and blueshifted outflow components have a common terminal velocity. This terminal velocity is 58 +/- 2 km s-1. It provides an excellent method for determination of the systematic velocity of the molecular cloud. The SMA observations have also shown that a large fraction of absorption against the two continuum cores is redshifted with respect to the systematic velocities of Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), respectively, suggesting that the majority of the dense molecular gas is flowing into the two major cores where massive stars have been formed. We have solved the radiative transfer in a multilevel system with LVG approximation. The observed H2CO line intensities and their ratios can be adequately fitted with this model for the most of the gas components. However, the line intensities between the higher energy level transition H2CO(321-220) and the lower energy level transition H2CO(303-202) is reversed in the redshifted outflow region of Sgr B2(M), suggesting the presence of inversion in population between the ground levels in the two K ladders (K-1 = 0 and 2). The possibility of weak maser processes for the H2CO emission in Sgr B2(M) is discussed.},

@article{Schuller:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Context: Thanks to its excellent 5100 m high site in Chajnantor, the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX) systematically explores the southern sky at submillimeter wavelengths, in both continuum and spectral line emission. Studying continuum emission from interstellar dust is essential to locating the highest density regions in the interstellar medium, and deriving their masses, column densities, density structures, and large-scale morphologies. In particular, the early stages of (massive) star formation remain poorly understood, mainly because only small samples of high-mass proto-stellar or young stellar objects have been studied in detail so far.  Aims: Our goal is to produce a large-scale, systematic database of massive pre- and proto-stellar clumps in the Galaxy, to understand how and under what conditions star formation takes place. Only a systematic survey of the Galactic Plane can provide the statistical basis for unbiased studies. A well characterized sample of Galactic star-forming sites will deliver an evolutionary sequence and a mass function of high-mass, star-forming clumps. This systematic survey at submillimeter wavelengths also represents a preparatory work for Herschel and ALMA.  Methods: The APEX telescope is ideally located to observe the inner Milky Way. The Large APEX Bolometer Camera (LABOCA) is a 295-element bolometer array observing at 870 mum, with a beam size of 19.2 arcsec. Taking advantage of its large field of view (11.4 arcmin) and excellent sensitivity, we started an unbiased survey of the entire Galactic Plane accessible to APEX, with a typical noise level of 50-70 mJy/beam: the APEX Telescope Large Area Survey of the Galaxy (ATLASGAL).  Results: As a first step, we covered ~95 deg2 of the Galactic Plane. These data reveal ~6000 compact sources brighter than 0.25 Jy, or 63 sources per square degree, as well as extended structures, many of them filamentary. About two thirds of the compact sources have no bright infrared counterpart, and some of them are likely to correspond to the precursors of (high-mass) proto-stars or proto-clusters. Other compact sources harbor hot cores, compact H ii regions, or young embedded clusters, thus tracing more evolved stages after massive stars have formed. Assuming a typical distance of 5 kpc, most sources are clumps smaller than 1 pc with masses from a few 10 to a few 100 M&sun;. In this first introductory paper, we show preliminary results from these ongoing observations, and discuss the mid- and long-term perspectives of the survey.},

Along with maps at 160, 450, 850, and 1200 mum, we study the dust emissivity spectral index from the (sub)millimeter spectral energy distribution, and find that it is close to the typically assumed value of beta = 2. We also map the dust temperature and column density in TMC-1C, and find that at the position of the dust peak (AV ~ 50) the line-of-sight-averaged temperature is ~7 K.

@article{Molinari:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present the first results from the science demonstration phase for the Hi-GAL survey, the Herschel key program that will map the inner Galactic plane of the Milky Way in 5 bands. We outline our data reduction strategy and present some science highlights on the two observed 2$\,^{\circ}$ × 2$\,^{\circ}$ tiles approximately centered at l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$. The two regions are extremely rich in intense and highly structured extended emission which shows a widespread organization in filaments. Source SEDs can be built for hundreds of objects in the two fields, and physical parameters can be extracted, for a good fraction of them where the distance could be estimated. The compact sources (which we will call cores' in the following) are found for the most part to be associated with the filaments, and the relationship to the local beam-averaged column density of the filament itself shows that a core seems to appear when a threshold around AV ~ 1 is exceeded for the regions in the l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ field; a AV value between 5 and 10 is found for the l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ field, likely due to the relatively higher distances of the sources. This outlines an exciting scenario where diffuse clouds first collapse into filaments, which later fragment to cores where the column density has reached a critical level. In spite of core L/M ratios being well in excess of a few for many sources, we find core surface densities between 0.03 and 0.5 g cm-2. Our results are in good agreement with recent MHD numerical simulations of filaments forming from large-scale converging flows.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {Young massive clusters (YMCs) are dense aggregates of young stars that form the fundamental building blocks of galaxies. Several examples exist in the Milky Way Galaxy and the Local Group, but they are particularly abundant in starburst and interacting galaxies. The few YMCs that are close enough to resolve are of prime interest for studying the stellar mass function and the ecological interplay between stellar evolution and stellar dynamics. The distant unresolved clusters may be effectively used to study the star-cluster mass function, and they provide excellent constraints on the formation mechanisms of young cluster populations. YMCs are expected to be the nurseries for many unusual objects, including a wide range of exotic stars and binaries. So far only a few such objects have been found in YMCs, although their older cousins, the globular clusters, are unusually rich in stellar exotica. In this review, we focus on star clusters younger than ˜100 Myr, more than a few current crossing times old, and more massive than ˜104M&sun;; the size of the cluster and its environment are considered less relevant as distinguishing parameters. We describe the global properties of the currently known young massive star clusters in the Local Group and beyond, and discuss the state of the art in observations and dynamical modeling of these systems. In order to make this review readable by observers, theorists, and computational astrophysicists, we also review the cross-disciplinary terminology.},

@article{Bergin:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present initial results from the Herschel GT key program: Herschel observations of EXtra-Ordinary Sources (HEXOS) and outline the promise and potential of spectral surveys with Herschel/HIFI. The HIFI instrument offers unprecedented sensitivity, as well as continuous spectral coverage across the gaps imposed by the atmosphere, opening up a largely unexplored wavelength regime to high-resolution spectroscopy. We show the spectrum of Orion KL between 480 and 560 GHz and from 1.06 to 1.115 THz. From these data, we confirm that HIFI separately measures the dust continuum and spectrally resolves emission lines in Orion KL. Based on this capability we demonstrate that the line contribution to the broad-band continuum in this molecule-rich source is ~20-40% below 1 THz and declines to a few percent at higher frequencies. We also tentatively identify multiple transitions of HD18O in the spectra. The first detection of this rare isotopologue in the interstellar medium suggests that HDO emission is optically thick in the Orion hot core with HDO/H2O ~ 0.02. We discuss the implications of this detection for the water D/H ratio in hot cores.

	Abstract = {Massive stars form deeply embedded in dense molecular gas, which they stir and heat up and ionize. During an early phase, the ionization is confined to hypercompact Hii regions, and the stellar radiation is entirely absorbed by dust, giving rise to a hot molecular core. To investigate the innermost structure of such high-mass star-forming regions, we observed vibrationally excited HCN (via the direct l-type transition of v2 = 1, DeltaJ = 0, J = 13, which lies 1400 K above ground) toward the massive hot molecular cores G10.47+0.03, SgrB2-N, and SgrB2-M with the Very Large Array (VLA) at 7 mm, reaching a resolution of about 1000 AU (0.1''). We detect the line both in emission and in absorption against Hii regions. The latter allows to derive lower limits on the column densities of hot HCN, which are several times 1019 cm-2. We see indication of expansion motions in G10.47+0.03 and detect velocity components in SgrB2-M at 50, 60, and 70 km s-1 relative to the Local Standard of Rest. The emission originates in regions of less than 0.1 pc diameter around the hypercompact Hii regions G10.47+0.03 B1 and SgrB2-N K2, and reaches brightness temperatures of more than 200 K. Using the three-dimensional radiative transfer code RADMC-3D, we model the sources as dense dust cores heated by stars in the Hii regions, and derive masses of hot (>300 K) molecular gas of more than 100 solar masses (for an HCN fractional abundance of 10-5), challenging current simulations of massive star formation. Heating only by the stars in the Hii regions is sufficient to produce such large quantities of hot molecular gas, provided that dust is optically thick to its own radiation, leading to high temperatures through diffusion of radiation.},

	Abstract = {We report the first high spatial resolution submillimeter continuum observations of the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex using the Submillimeter Array (SMA). With the subarcsecond resolution provided by the SMA, the two massive star-forming clumps Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) are resolved into multiple compact sources. In total, twelve submillimeter cores are identified in the Sgr B2(M) region, while only two components are observed in the Sgr B2(N) clump. The gas mass and column density are estimated from the dust continuum emission. We find that most of the cores have gas masses in excess of 100 M&sun; and column densities above 1025 cm-2. The very fragmented appearance of Sgr B2(M), in contrast to the monolithic structure of Sgr B2 (N), suggests that the former is more evolved. The density profile of the Sgr B2(N)-SMA1 core is well fitted by a Plummer density distribution. This would lead one to believe that in the evolutionary sequence of the Sgr B2 cloud complex, a massive star forms first in an homogeneous core, and the rest of the cluster forms subsequently in the then fragmenting structure.},

@article{Cesaroni:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Context. The role of disks in the formation of high-mass stars is still a matter of debate but the detection of circumstellar disks around O-type stars would have a profound impact on high-mass star formation theories.  Aims: We made a detailed observational analysis of a well known hot molecular core lying in the high-mass star-forming region G31.41+0.31. This core is believed to contain deeply embedded massive stars and presents a velocity gradient that has been interpreted either as rotation or as expansion, depending on the authors. Our aim was to shed light on this question and possibly prepare the ground for higher resolution ALMA observations, which could directly detect circumstellar disks around the embedded massive stars.  Methods: Observations at sub-arcsecond resolution were performed with the Submillimeter Array in methyl cyanide, a typical hot molecular core tracer, and 12CO and 13CO, well known outflow tracers. We also obtained sensitive continuum maps at 1.3 mm.  Results: Our findings confirm the existence of a sharp velocity gradient across the core, but cannot confirm the existence of a bipolar outflow perpendicular to it. The improved angular resolution and sampling of the uv plane allow us to attain higher quality channel maps of the CH3CN lines with respect to previous studies and thus significantly improve our knowledge of the structure and kinematics of the hot molecular core.  Conclusions: While no conclusive argument can rule out any of the two interpretations (rotation or expansion) proposed to explain the velocity gradient observed in the core, in our opinion the observational evidence collected so far indicates the rotating toroid as the most likely scenario. The outflow hypothesis appears less plausible, because the dynamical time scale is too short compared to that needed to form species such as CH3CN, and the mass loss and momentum rates estimated from our measurements appear too high.  Based on observations carried out with the Submillimeter Array.

@article{Sanchez-Monge:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: We present Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) observations of the H2O maser line and radio continuum at 18.0 GHz and 22.8 GHz toward a sample of 192 massive star-forming regions containing several clumps already imaged at 1.2 mm. The main aim of this study is to investigate the water maser and centimeter continuum emission (that likely traces thermal free-free emission) in sources at different evolutionary stages, using evolutionary classifications previously published.  Methods: We used the recently comissioned Compact Array Broadband Backend (CABB) at ATCA that obtains images with ~20'' resolution in the 1.3 cm continuum and H2O maser emission in all targets. For the evolutionary analysis of the sources we used millimeter continuum emission from the literature and the infrared emission from the MSX Point Source Catalog.  Results: We detect centimeter continuum emission in 88% of the observed fields with a typical rms noise level of 0.45 mJy beam-1. Most of the fields show a single radio continuum source, while in 20% of them we identify multiple components. A total of 214 cm continuum sources have been identified, that likely trace optically thin H ii regions, with physical parameters typical of both extended and compact H ii regions. Water maser emission was detected in 41% of the regions, resulting in a total of 85 distinct components. The low angular (~20'') and spectral (~14 km s-1) resolutions do not allow a proper analysis of the water maser emission, but suffice to investigate its association with the continuum sources. We have also studied the detection rate of H ii regions in the two types of IRAS sources defined in the literature on the basis of the IRAS colors: High and Low. No significant differences are found, with high detection rates (>90%) for both High and Low sources.  Conclusions: We classify the millimeter and infrared sources in our fields in three evolutionary stages following the scheme presented previously: (Type 1) millimeter-only sources, (Type 2) millimeter plus infrared sources, (Type 3) infrared-only sources. We find that H ii regions are mainly associated with Type 2 and Type 3 objects, confirming that these are more evolved than Type 1 sources. The H ii regions associated with Type 3 sources are slightly less dense and larger in size than those associated with Type 2 sources, as expected if the H ii region expands as it evolves, and Type 3 objects are older than Type 2 objects. The maser emission is mostly found to be associated with Type 1 and Type 2 sources, with a higher detection rate toward Type 2, consistent with the results of the literature. Finally, our results on H ii region and H2O maser association with different evolutionary types confirm the evolutionary classification proposed previously.

	Abstract = {Context. The discovery of amino acids in meteorites fallen to Earth and the detection of glycine, the simplest of them, in samples returned from a comet to Earth strongly suggest that the chemistry of the interstellar medium is capable of producing such complex organic molecules and that they may be widespread in our Galaxy.  Aims: Our goal is to investigate the degree of chemical complexity that can be reached in the interstellar medium, in particular in dense star-forming regions.  Methods: We performed an unbiased, spectral line survey toward Sgr B2(N) and (M), two regions where high-mass stars are formed, with the IRAM 30 m telescope in the 3 mm atmospheric transmission window. Partial surveys at 2 and 1.3 mm were performed in parallel. The spectra were analyzed with a simple radiative transfer model that assumes local thermodynamic equilibrium but takes optical depth effects into account.  Results: About 3675 and 945 spectral lines with a peak signal-to-noise ratio higher than 4 are detected at 3 mm toward Sgr B2(N) and (M), i.e. about 102 and 26 lines per GHz, respectively. This represents an increase by about a factor of two over previous surveys of Sgr B2. About 70% and 47% of the lines detected toward Sgr B2(N) and (M) are identified and assigned to 56 and 46 distinct molecules as well as to 66 and 54 less abundant isotopologues of these molecules, respectively. In addition, we report the detection of transitions from 59 and 24 catalog entries corresponding to vibrationally or torsionally excited states of some of these molecules, respectively, up to a vibration energy of 1400 cm-1 (2000 K). Excitation temperatures and column densities were derived for each species but should be used with caution. The rotation temperatures of the detected complex molecules typically range from ~50 to 200 K. Among the detected molecules, aminoacetonitrile, n-propyl cyanide, and ethyl formate were reported for the first time in space based on this survey, as were five rare isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, cyanoacetylene, and hydrogen cyanide. We also report the detection of transitions from within twelve new vibrationally or torsionally excited states of known molecules. Absorption features produced by diffuse clouds along the line of sight are detected in transitions with low rotation quantum numbers of many simple molecules and are modeled with ~30-40 velocity components with typical linewidths of ~3-5 km s-1.  Conclusions: Although the large number of unidentified lines may still allow future identification of new molecules, we expect most of these lines to belong to vibrationally or torsionally excited states or to rare isotopologues of known molecules for which spectroscopic predictions are currently missing. Significant progress in extending the inventory of complex organic molecules in Sgr B2(N) and deriving tighter constraints on their location, origin, and abundance is expected in the near future thanks to an ongoing spectral line survey at 3 mm with ALMA in its cycles 0 and 1. The present single-dish survey will serve as a solid basis for the line identification and analysis of such an interferometric survey.  Based on observations carried out with the IRAM 30 m telescope. IRAM is supported by INSU/CNRS (France), MPG (Germany), and IGN (Spain).Figures 2-7 and Tables 6-107 are available in electronic form at http://www.aanda.orgThe observed and synthetic 3 mm spectra of Sgr B2(N) and (M), as well as the lists of line identifications corresponding to the blue lab- els in Figs. 2-7, are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/559/A47},

	Abstract = {Over 100 trigonometric parallaxes and proper motions for masers associated with young, high-mass stars have been measured with the Bar and Spiral Structure Legacy Survey, a Very Long Baseline Array key science project, the European VLBI Network, and the Japanese VLBI Exploration of Radio Astrometry project. These measurements provide strong evidence for the existence of spiral arms in the Milky Way, accurately locating many arm segments and yielding spiral pitch angles ranging from about 7$\,^{\circ}$ to 20$\,^{\circ}$. The widths of spiral arms increase with distance from the Galactic center. Fitting axially symmetric models of the Milky Way with the three-dimensional position and velocity information and conservative priors for the solar and average source peculiar motions, we estimate the distance to the Galactic center, R 0, to be 8.34 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc, a circular rotation speed at the Sun, Theta0, to be 240 $\pm$ 8 km s-1, and a rotation curve that is nearly flat (i.e., a slope of -0.2 $\pm$ 0.4 km s-1 kpc-1) between Galactocentric radii of ≈5 and 16 kpc. Assuming a "universal" spiral galaxy form for the rotation curve, we estimate the thin disk scale length to be 2.44 $\pm$ 0.16 kpc. With this large data set, the parameters R 0 and Theta0 are no longer highly correlated and are relatively insensitive to different forms of the rotation curve. If one adopts a theoretically motivated prior that high-mass star forming regions are in nearly circular Galactic orbits, we estimate a global solar motion component in the direction of Galactic rotation, V &sun; = 14.6 $\pm$ 5.0 km s-1. While Theta0 and V &sun; are significantly correlated, the sum of these parameters is well constrained, Theta0 + V &sun; = 255.2 $\pm$ 5.1 km s-1, as is the angular speed of the Sun in its orbit about the Galactic center, (Theta0 + V &sun;)/R 0 = 30.57 $\pm$ 0.43 km s-1 kpc-1. These parameters improve the accuracy of estimates of the accelerations of the Sun and the Hulse-Taylor binary pulsar in their Galactic orbits, significantly reducing the uncertainty in tests of gravitational radiation predicted by general relativity.},

@article{Schilke:2014aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: We describe the assignment of a previously unidentified interstellar absorption line to ArH+ and discuss its relevance in the context of hydride absorption in diffuse gas with a low H2 fraction. The confidence of the assignment to ArH+ is discussed, and the column densities are determined toward several lines of sight. The results are then discussed in the framework of chemical models, with the aim of explaining the observed column densities.  Methods: We fitted the spectral lines with multiple velocity components, and determined column densities from the line-to-continuum ratio. The column densities of ArH+ were compared to those of other species, tracing interstellar medium (ISM) components with different H2 abundances. We constructed chemical models that take UV radiation and cosmic ray ionization into account.  Results: Thanks to the detection of two isotopologues, 36ArH+ and 38ArH+, we are confident about the carrier assignment to ArH+. NeH+ is not detected with a limit of [NeH+]/[ArH+] <= 0.1. The derived column densities agree well with the predictions of chemical models. ArH+ is a unique tracer of gas with a fractional H2 abundance of 10-4 - 10-3 and shows little correlation to H2O+, which traces gas with a fractional H2 abundance of ≈0.1.  Conclusions: A careful analysis of variations in the ArH+, OH+, H2O+, and HF column densities promises to be a faithful tracer of the distribution of the H2 fractional abundance by providing unique information on a poorly known phase in the cycle of interstellar matter and on its transition from atomic diffuse gas to dense molecular gas traced by CO emission. Abundances of these species put strong observational constraints upon magnetohydrodynamical (MHD)simulations of the interstellar medium, and potentially could evolve into a tool characterizing the ISM. Paradoxically, the ArH+ molecule is a better tracer of almost purely atomic hydrogen gas than Hi itself, since Hi can also be present in gas with a significant molecular content, but ArH+ singles out gas that is >99.9% atomic.},

	Abstract = {A sensitive broadband molecular line survey of the Sagittarius B2(N) star-forming region has been obtained with the Heterodyne Instrument for the Far-Infrared (HIFI) instrument on the Herschel Space Observatory, offering the first high spectral resolution look at this well-studied source in a wavelength region largely inaccessible from the ground (625-157 mum). From the roughly 8000 spectral features in the survey, a total of 72 isotopologues arising from 44 different molecules have been identified, ranging from light hydrides to complex organics, and arising from a variety of environments from cold and diffuse to hot and dense gas. We present a local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) model to the spectral signatures of each molecule, constraining the source sizes for hot core species with complementary Submillimeter Array interferometric observations and assuming that molecules with related functional group composition are cospatial. For each molecule, a single model is given to fit all of the emission and absorption features of that species across the entire 480-1910 GHz spectral range, accounting for multiple temperature and velocity components when needed to describe the spectrum. As with other HIFI surveys toward massive star-forming regions, methanol is found to contribute more integrated line intensity to the spectrum than any other species. We discuss the molecular abundances derived for the hot core where the LTE approximation is generally found to describe the spectrum well, in comparison to abundances derived for the same molecules in the Orion KL region from a similar HIFI survey. Notably, we find significantly higher abundances of amine- and amide-bearing molecules (CH3NH2, CH2NH, and NH2CHO) toward Sgr B2(N) than Orion KL and lower abundances of some complex oxygen-bearing molecules (CH3OCHO in particular). In addition to information on the chemical composition of the hot core, the strong far-infrared dust continuum allows a number of molecules to be detected in absorption in the Sgr B2(N) envelope for the first time at high spectral resolution, and we discuss the possible physical origin of the kinematic components observed in absorption. Additionally, from the detection of new HOCO+ transitions in absorption compared to published HCO+ isotopic observations, we discuss constraints on the gas-phase CO2 abundance and compare this to observations of the ice composition in the Galactic center region, and to CO2 abundance estimates toward other high-mass star-forming regions. The reduced HIFI spectral scan and LTE model are made available to the public as a resource for future investigations of star-forming regions in the submillimeter and far-infrared.

	Abstract = {The largest noncyclic molecules detected in the interstellar medium (ISM) are organic with a straight-chain carbon backbone. We report an interstellar detection of a branched alkyl molecule, iso-propyl cyanide (i-C3H7CN), with an abundance 0.4 times that of its straight-chain structural isomer. This detection suggests that branched carbon-chain molecules may be generally abundant in the ISM. Our astrochemical model indicates that both isomers are produced within or upon dust grain ice mantles through the addition of molecular radicals, albeit via differing reaction pathways. The production of iso-propyl cyanide appears to require the addition of a functional group to a nonterminal carbon in the chain. Its detection therefore bodes well for the presence in the ISM of amino acids, for which such side-chain structure is a key characteristic.},

	Abstract = {We present a new 3.3 mm continuum map of the Orion Molecular Cloud (OMC) 2/3 region. When paired with previously published maps of 1.2 mm continuum and NH3-derived temperature, we derive the emissivity spectral index of dust emission in this region, tracking its changes across the filament and cores. We find that the median value of the emissivity spectral index is 0.9, much shallower than previous estimates in other nearby molecular clouds. We find no significant difference between the emissivity spectral index of dust in the OMC 2/3 filament and the starless or protostellar cores. Furthermore, the temperature and emissivity spectral index, beta, are anticorrelated at the 4sigma level. The low values of the emissivity spectral index found in OMC 2/3 can be explained by the presence of millimetre-sized dust grains in the dense regions of the filaments to which these maps are most sensitive. Alternatively, a shallow dust emissivity spectral index may indicate non-power-law spectral energy distributions, significant free-free emission, or anomalous microwave emission. We discuss the possible implications of millimetre-sized dust grains compared to the alternatives.},

ADMIT quickly provides users with a detailed overview of their science products: line identifications, line 'cutout' cubes, moment maps, emission type analysis (e.g., feature detection), etc. Users can download the small ADMIT pipeline product (< 20MB), analyze the results, then fine-tune and re-run the ADMIT pipeline (or any part thereof) on their own machines and interactively inspect the results. ADMIT will have both a GUI and command line interface available for this purpose. By analyzing multiple data cubes simultaneously, data mining between many astronomical sources and line transitions will be possible. Users will also be able to enhance the capabilities of ADMIT by creating customized ADMIT tasks satisfying any special processing needs.

	Abstract = {How rapidly collapsing parsec-scale massive molecular clumps feed high-mass stars and how they fragment to form OB clusters have been outstanding questions in the field of star formation. In this work, we report the resolved structures and kinematics of the approximately face-on, rotating massive molecular clump, G33.92+0.11. Our high-resolution Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array images show that the spiral arm-like gas overdensities form in the eccentric gas accretion streams. First, we resolved that the dominant part of the ˜0.6 pc scale massive molecular clump (3.0-1.4+2.8·103 {{M}&sun; }) G33.92+0.11 A is tangled with several 0.5-1 pc size molecular arms spiraling around it, which may be connected further to exterior gas accretion streams. Within G33.92+0.11 A, we resolved the ˜0.1 pc width gas mini-arms connecting to the two central massive (100-300 {{M}&sun; }) molecular cores. The kinematics of arms and cores elucidate a coherent accretion flow continuing from large to small scales. We demonstrate that the large molecular arms are indeed the cradles of dense cores, which are likely current or future sites of high-mass star formation. Since these deeply embedded massive molecular clumps preferentially form the highest-mass stars in the clusters, we argue that dense cores fed by or formed within molecular arms play a key role in making the upper end of the stellar and core mass functions.},

	Abstract = {Sufficiently massive clumps of molecular gas collapse under self-gravity and fragment to spawn a cluster of stars that have a range of masses. We investigate observationally the early stages of formation of a stellar cluster in a massive filamentary infrared dark cloud, G28.34+0.06 P1, in the 1.3 mm continuum and spectral line emission using the Atacama Large Millimeter/Submillimeter Array. Sensitive continuum data reveal further fragmentation in five dusty cores at a resolution of several 103 AU. Spectral line emission from C18O, CH3OH, 13CS, H2CO, and N2D+ is detected for the first time toward these dense cores. We found that three cores are chemically more evolved as compared with the other two; interestingly, though, all of them are associated with collimated outflows as suggested by evidence from the CO, SiO, CH3OH, H2CO, and SO emission. The parsec-scale kinematics in  exhibit velocity gradients along the filament, consistent with accretion flows toward the clumps and cores. The moderate luminosity and the chemical signatures indicate that the five cores harbor low- to intermediate-mass protostars that likely become massive ones at the end of the accretion. Despite the fact that the mass limit reached by the  dust continuum sensitivity is 30 times lower than the thermal Jeans mass, there is a lack of a distributed low-mass protostellar population in the clump. Our observations indicate that in a protocluster, low-mass stars form at a later stage after the birth of more massive protostars.},

	Abstract = {A major goal of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) is to make accurate images with resolutions of tens of milliarcseconds, which at submillimeter (submm) wavelengths requires baselines up to ˜15 km. To develop and test this capability, a Long Baseline Campaign (LBC) was carried out from 2014 September to late November, culminating in end-to-end observations, calibrations, and imaging of selected Science Verification (SV) targets. This paper presents an overview of the campaign and its main results, including an investigation of the short-term coherence properties and systematic phase errors over the long baselines at the ALMA site, a summary of the SV targets and observations, and recommendations for science observing strategies at long baselines. Deep ALMA images of the quasar 3C 138 at 97 and 241 GHz are also compared to VLA 43 GHz results, demonstrating an agreement at a level of a few percent. As a result of the extensive program of LBC testing, the highly successful SV imaging at long baselines achieved angular resolutions as fine as 19 mas at ˜350 GHz. Observing with ALMA on baselines of up to 15 km is now possible, and opens up new parameter space for submm astronomy.  .},

@article{Reach:2015aa,
	Abstract = {Using the Planck far-infrared and Arecibo GALFA 21 cm line surveys, we identified a set of isolated interstellar clouds (approximately degree-sized on the sky and comprising 100 solar masses) and assessed the ratio of gas mass to dust mass. Significant variations of the gas/dust ratio are found both from cloud to cloud and within regions of individual clouds; within the clouds, the atomic gas per unit dust decreases by more than a factor of 3 compared with the standard gas/dust ratio. Three hypotheses are considered. First, the apparently low gas/dust ratio could be due to molecular gas. Comparing to Planck CO maps, the brightest clouds have a H2/CO ratio comparable to Galactic plane clouds, but a strong lower limit is placed on the ratio for other clouds, such that the required amount of molecular gas is far higher than would be expected based on the CO upper limits. Second, we consider self-absorbed 21 cm lines and find that the optical depth must be ~3, significantly higher than found from surveys of radio sources. Third, grain properties may change within the clouds: they become more emissive when they are colder, while not utilizing heavy elements that already have their cosmic abundance fully locked into grains. It is possible that all three processes are active, and follow-up studies will be required to disentangle them and measure the true total gas and dust content of interstellar clouds.},

	Abstract = {We present a 30-50 GHz survey of Sagittarius B2(N) conducted with the Australia Telescope Compact Array with ˜5-10 arcsec resolution. This work releases the survey data and demonstrates the utility of scripts that perform automated spectral line fitting on broad-band line data. We describe the line-fitting procedure, evaluate the performance of the method, and provide access to all data and scripts. The scripts are used to characterize the spectra at the positions of three H II regions, each with recombination line emission and molecular line absorption. Towards the most line-dense of the three regions characterized in this work, we detect ˜500 spectral line components of which ˜90 per cent are confidently assigned to H and He recombination lines and to 53 molecular species and their isotopologues. The data reveal extremely sub-thermally excited molecular gas absorbing against the continuum background at two primary velocity components. Based on the line radiation over the full spectra, the molecular abundances and line excitation in the absorbing components appear to vary substantially towards the different positions, possibly indicating that the two gas clouds are located proximate to the star-forming cores instead of within the envelope of Sgr B2. Furthermore, the spatial distributions of species including CS, OCS, SiO, and HNCO indicate that the absorbing gas components likely have high UV-flux. Finally, the data contain line-of-sight absorption by ˜15 molecules observed in translucent gas in the Galactic Centre, bar, and intervening spiral arm clouds, revealing the complex chemistry and clumpy structure of this gas. Formamide (NH2CHO) is detected for the first time in a translucent cloud.},

	Abstract = {Context. The Galactic Cold Cores project has carried out Herschel photometric observations of 116 fields where the Planck survey has found signs of cold dust emission. The fields contain sources in different environments and different phases of star formation. Previous studies have revealed variations in their dust submillimetre opacity.  Aims: The aim is to measure the value of dust opacity spectral index and to understand its variations spatially and with respect to other parameters, such as temperature, column density, and Galactic location.  Methods: The dust opacity spectral index beta and the dust colour temperature T are derived using Herschel and Planck data. The relation between beta and T is examined for the whole sample and inside individual fields.  Results: Based on IRAS and Planck data, the fields are characterised by a median colour temperature of 16.1 K and a median opacity spectral index of beta = 1.84. The values are not correlated with Galactic longitude. We observe a clear T-beta anti-correlation. In Herschel observations, constrained at lower resolution by Planck data, the variations follow the column density structure and betaFIR can rise to ~2.2 in individual clumps. The highest values are found in starless clumps. The Planck 217 GHz band shows a systematic excess that is not restricted to cold clumps and is thus consistent with a general flattening of the dust emission spectrum at millimetre wavelengths. When fitted separately below and above 700 mum, the median spectral index values are betaFIR ~ 1.91 and beta(mm) ~ 1.66.  Conclusions: The spectral index changes as a function of column density and wavelength. The comparison of different data sets and the examination of possible error sources show that our results are robust. However, beta variations are partly masked by temperature gradients and the changes in the intrinsic grain properties may be even greater.

	Abstract = {Context. Deuteration is a powerful tracer of the history of the cold prestellar phase in star-forming regions. Apart from methanol, little is known about deuterium fractionation of complex organic molecules in the interstellar medium, especially in regions forming high-mass stars.  Aims: Our goal is to detect deuterated complex organic molecules toward the high mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2) and derive the level of deuteration for these molecules.  Methods: We use a complete 3-mm spectral line survey performed with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to search for deuterated complex organic molecules toward the hot molecular core Sgr B2(N2). We constructed population diagrams and integrated intensity maps to fit rotational temperatures and emission sizes for each molecule. Column densities are derived by modeling the full spectrum under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. We compare the results to predictions of two astrochemical models that treat the deuteration process.  Results: We report the detection of CH2DCN toward Sgr B2(N2) with a deuteration level of 0.4%, and tentative detections of CH2DOH, CH2DCH2CN, the chiral molecule CH3CHDCN, and DC3N with levels in the range 0.05%-0.12%. A stringent deuteration upper limit is obtained for CH3OD (<0.07%). Upper limits in the range 0.5-1.8% are derived for the three deuterated isotopologues of vinyl cyanide, the four deuterated species of ethanol, and CH2DOCHO. Ethyl cyanide is less deuterated than methyl cyanide by at least a factor five. The [CH2DOH]/[CH3OD] abundance ratio is higher than 1.8. It may still be consistent with the value obtained in Orion KL. Except for methyl cyanide, the measured deuteration levels lie at least a factor four below the predictions of current astrochemical models. The deuteration levels in Sgr B2(N2) are also lower than in Orion KL by a factor of a few up to a factor ten.  Conclusions: The discrepancy between the deuteration levels of Sgr B2(N2) and the predictions of chemical models, and the difference between Sgr B2(N2) and Orion KL may both be due to the higher kinetic temperatures that characterize the Galactic center region compared to nearby clouds. Alternatively, they may result from a lower overall abundance of deuterium itself in the Galactic center region by up to a factor ten.},

@article{Muller:2016aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Over the past five decades, radio astronomy has shown that molecular complexity is a natural outcome of interstellar chemistry, in particular in star forming regions. However, the pathways that lead to the formation of complex molecules are not completely understood and the depth of chemical complexity has not been entirely revealed. In addition, the sulfur chemistry in the dense interstellar medium is not well understood.  Aims: We want to know the relative abundances of alkanethiols and alkanols in the Galactic center source Sagittarius B2(N2), the northern hot molecular core in Sgr B2(N), whose relatively small line widths are favorable for studying the molecular complexity in space.  Methods: We investigated spectroscopic parameter sets that were able to reproduce published laboratory rotational spectra of ethanethiol and studied effects that modify intensities in the predicted rotational spectrum of ethanol. We used the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in its Cycles 0 and 1 for a spectral line survey of Sagittarius B2(N) between 84 and 114.4 GHz. These data were analyzed by assuming local thermodynamic equilibrium (LTE) for each molecule. Our observations are supplemented by astrochemical modeling; a new network is used that includes reaction pathways for alkanethiols for the first time.  Results: We detected methanol and ethanol in their parent 12C species and their isotopologs with one 12C atom substituted by 13C; the latter were detected for the first time unambiguously in the case of ethanol. The 12C/13C ratio is ~25 for both molecules. In addition, we identified CH318 OH with a 16O/18O ratio of ~180 and a 13CH3OH/CH318 OH ratio of ~7.3. Upper limits were derived for the next larger alkanols normal- and iso-propanol. We observed methanethiol, CH3SH, also known as methyl mercaptan, including torsionally excited transitions for the first time. We also identified transitions of ethanethiol (or ethyl mercaptan), though not enough to claim a secure detection in this source. The ratios CH3SH to C2H5SH and C2H5OH to C2H5SH are ≳21 and ≳125, respectively. In the process of our study, we noted severe discrepancies in the intensities of observed and predicted ethanol transitions and propose a change in the relative signs of the dipole moment components. In addition, we determined alternative sets of spectroscopic parameters for ethanethiol. The astrochemical models indicate that substantial quantities of both CH3SH and C2H5SH may be produced on the surfaces of dust grains, to be later released into the gas phase. The modeled ratio CH3SH/C2H5SH = 3.1 is lower than the observed value of ≳21; the model value appears to be affected most by the underprediction of CH3SH relative to CH3OH and C2H5OH, as judged by a very high CH3OH/CH3SH ratio.  Conclusions: The column density ratios involving methanol, ethanol, and methanethiol in Sgr B2(N2) are similar to values reported for Orion KL, but those involving ethanethiol are significantly different and suggest that the detection of ethanethiol reported toward Orion KL is uncertain. Our chemical model presently does not permit the prediction of sufficiently accurate column densities of alkanethiols or their ratios among alkanethiols and alkanols. Therefore, additional observational results are required to establish the level of C2H5SH in the dense and warm interstellar medium with certainty.},

	Abstract = {Context. We model the dust and free-free continuum emission in the high-mass star-forming region Sagittarius B2.  Aims: We want to reconstruct the 3D density and dust temperature distribution, as a crucial input to follow-up studies of the gas velocity field and molecular abundances.  Methods: We employ the 3D radiative transfer program RADMC-3D to calculate the dust temperature self-consistently, providing a given initial density distribution. This density distribution of the entire cloud complex is then recursively reconstructed, based on available continuum maps, including both single-dish and high-resolution interferometric maps that cover a wide frequency range (nu = 40 GHz-4 THz). The model covers spatial scales from 45 pc down to 100 au, i.e., a spatial dynamic range of 105.  Results: We find that the density distribution of Sagittarius B2 can be reasonably well fitted by applying a superposition of spherical cores with Plummer-like density profiles. To reproduce the spectral energy distribution, we position Sgr B2(N) along the line of sight behind the plane containing Sgr B2(M). We find that the entire cloud complex comprises a total gas mass of 8.0 × 106 M&sun; within a diameter of 45 pc. This corresponds to an averaged gas density of 170 M&sun; pc-3. We estimate stellar masses of 2400 M&sun; and 20 700 M&sun; and luminosities of 1.8 × 106 L&sun; and 1.2 × 107 L&sun; for Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M), respectively. We report H2 column densities of 2.9 × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(N) and 2.5 × 1024 cm-2 for Sgr B2(M) in a 40'' beam. For Sgr B2(S), we derive a stellar mass of 1100 M&sun;, a luminosity of 6.6 × 105 L&sun;, and an H2 column density of 2.2 × 1024 cm-2 in a 40'' beam. We calculate a star formation efficiency of 5% for Sgr B2(N) and 50% for Sgr B2(M). This indicates that most of the gas content in Sgr B2(M) has already been converted to stars or dispersed.},

	Abstract = {We present new JVLA observations of the high-mass cluster-forming region W51A from 2 to 16 GHz with resolution thetafwhm ≈ 0.3-0.5". The data reveal a wealth of observational results: (1) Currently forming, very massive (proto-O) stars are traced by o - H2CO21,1-21,2 emission, suggesting that this line can be used efficiently as a massive protostar tracer; (2) there is a spatially distributed population of ≲mJy continuum sources, including hypercompact H ii regions and candidate colliding wind binaries, in and around the W51 proto-clusters; and (3) there are two clearly detected protoclusters, W51e and W51 IRS2, that are gas-rich but may have most of their mass in stars within their inner ≲0.05 pc. The majority of the bolometric luminosity in W51 most likely comes from a third population of OB stars between these clusters. The presence of a substantial population of exposed O-stars coincident with a population of still-forming massive stars, together with a direct measurement of the low mass loss rate via ionized gas outflow from W51 IRS2, implies that feedback is ineffective at halting star formation in massive protoclusters. Instead, feedback may shut off the large-scale accretion of diffuse gas onto the W51 protoclusters, implying that they are evolving toward a state of gas exhaustion rather than gas expulsion. Recent theoretical models predict gas exhaustion to be a necessary step in the formation of gravitationally bound stellar clusters, and our results provide an observational validation of this process.

	Abstract = {Context. The Sagittarius B2 molecular cloud contains several sites forming high-mass stars. Sgr B2(N) is one of its main centers of activity. It hosts several compact and ultra-compact HII regions, as well as two known hot molecular cores (Sgr B2(N1) and Sgr B2(N2)) in the early stage of the high-mass star formation process, where complex organic molecules (COMs) are detected in the gas phase.  Aims: Our goal is to use the high sensitivity of the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to characterize the hot core population in Sgr B2(N) and thereby shed new light on the star formation process in this star-forming region.  Methods: We use a complete 3 mm spectral line survey conducted with ALMA to search for faint hot cores in the Sgr B2(N) region. The chemical composition of the detected sources and the column densities are derived by modeling the whole spectra under the assumption of local thermodynamic equilibrium. Population diagrams are constructed to fit rotational temperatures. Integrated intensity maps are produced to derive the peak position and fit the size of each molecule's emission distribution. The kinematic structure of the hot cores is investigated by analyzing the line wing emission of typical outflow tracers. The H2 column densities are computed from ALMA and SMA continuum emission maps.  Results: We report the discovery of three new hot cores in Sgr B2(N) that we call Sgr B2(N3), Sgr B2(N4), and Sgr B2(N5). The three sources are associated with class II methanol masers, well known tracers of high-mass star formation, and Sgr B2(N5), also with a UCHII region. Their H2 column densities are found to be between approximately 16 and 36 times lower than the one of the main hot core Sgr B2(N1). The spectra of these new hot cores have spectral line densities of 11 up to 31 emission lines per GHz above the 7sigma level, assigned to 22-25 molecules plus 13-20 less abundant isotopologs. We derive rotational temperatures of approximately 140-180 K for the three new hot cores and mean source sizes of 0.4" for Sgr B2(N3) and 1.0" for Sgr B2(N4) and Sgr B2(N5). The chemical composition of Sgr B2(N3), Sgr B2(N4), and Sgr B2(N5) is very similar, but it differs from that of Sgr B2(N2). Finally, Sgr B2(N3) and Sgr B2(N5) show high-velocity wing emission in typical outflow tracers, with a bipolar morphology in their integrated intensity maps suggesting the presence of an outflow, like in Sgr B2(N1). No sign of an outflow is found around Sgr B2(N2) and Sgr B2(N4). We derive statistical lifetimes of 4 × 104 yr for the class II methanol maser phase and 6 × 104 yr for the hot core phase in Sgr B2(N).  Conclusions: The associations of the hot cores with class II methanol masers, outflows, and/or UCHII regions tentatively suggest the following age sequence: Sgr B2(N4), Sgr B2(N3), SgrB2(N5), Sgr B2(N1). The status of Sgr B2(N2) is unclear. It may contain two distinct sources, a UCHII region and a very young hot core.},

@article{Martin-Pintado:1999aa,
	Abstract = {We present high-resolution (3") maps of the (3, 3) and (4, 4) lines of NH3 toward the southern part of the molecular envelope of the Sagittarius B2 star-forming region. These maps reveal, for the first time, that the morphology of the hot gas in the Sgr B2 envelope is dominated by at least six rings, two arcs, and a filament. The sizes of the rings are between 1 and 2.6 pc and their thicknesses between 0.2 and 0.4 pc. Most of the gas in the rings is warm, with kinetic temperatures, Tk, of 40-70 K, although some parts of the low-velocity rings reach temperatures larger than 100 K. These hot rings and arcs represent regions of enhanced H2 density and/or enhanced NH3 abundance in the Sgr B2 envelope. Some of the hot rings show radial velocity gradients, which suggests that the rings and arcs correspond to three-dimensional shells expanding at velocities of ~6-10 km s-1. The walls of the hot shells are highly clumped and contain unresolved condensations (<~1") in the line maps. There are two kinds of unresolved condensations: those appearing in the (3, 3) line maps with only weak emission in the (4, 4) line and those with rather strong emission in the (4, 4) line compared with that of the (3, 3) line. For the first kind, we identify six condensations in the NH3 (3, 3) line maps that have brightness temperatures larger than the kinetic temperatures. It is likely that these are newly found NH3 masers. We also find that other masers in the region such as class II CH3OH and H2CO masers are very well correlated in velocity and position with the hot shells. The large number of masers observed in the hot shells can be explained as a result of the combination of high abundance of volatile molecules like NH3, CH3OH, and H2CO (produced by hot temperature and/or shock chemistry) and sufficient velocity coherence at the edges of the expanding shells. For the second kind of condensations, we have identified three compact sources in the walls of the shells that are hot (Tk>~300 K) and have high H2 densities (>~106-107 cm-3). These exhibit characteristics similar to those of the hot cores associated with newly formed massive stars. The inferred dust luminosity for the hot cores is at least 105 Lsolar, similar to the Orion A hot core. The high luminosity of the hot cores and the lack of associated radio continuum emission indicates that these are internally heated and very likely associated with the dense circumstellar material surrounding newly formed stars. The detection of hot cores suggests that massive star formation is not restricted to only Sgr B2N and Sgr B2M but is also taking place in the envelope of Sgr B2. Very likely, this star formation has been triggered by the expanding bubbles that produce the shells seen in the NH3 inversion lines. We discuss the possible origin of these hot shells. We find that a wind-blown bubble driven by typical Galactic Wolf-Rayet stars could account for the kinetic energies and the momenta observed in the hot NH3 shells. A cluster containing massive evolved stars such as the Quintuplet could easily explain the large concentration of hot shells, the heating of the warm envelope, and the peculiar chemistry observed in the envelope of Sgr B2. The implication of these findings for the heating of Galactic center molecular clouds is briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present images of the Sagittarius (Sgr) B giant molecular cloud at 1384 and 2368 MHz obtained using new, multi-configuration Australia Telescope Compact Array observations. We have combined these observations with archival single-dish observations yielding images at resolutions of 47'' × 14'' and 27'' × 8'' at 1384 and 2368 MHz, respectively. These observations were motivated by our theoretical work indicating the possibility that synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons created in hadronic cosmic ray (CR) collisions with the ambient matter of the Sgr B2 cloud could provide a detectable (and possibly linearly polarized) non-thermal radio signal. We find that the only detectable non-thermal emission from the Sgr B region is from a strong source to the south of Sgr B2, which we label Sgr B2 Southern Complex (SC). We find Sgr B2(SC) integrated flux densities of 1.2 $\pm$ 0.2 Jy at 1384 MHz and 0.7 $\pm$ 0.1 Jy at 2368 MHz for a source of FWHM size at 1384 MHz of ~54''. Despite its non-thermal nature, the synchrotron emission from this source is unlikely to be dominated due to secondary electrons and positrons. Failing to find clear evidence of non-thermal emission due to secondary electrons and positrons, we use polarization data to place 5sigma upper limits on the level of polarized intensity from the Sgr B2 cloud of 3.5 and 3 mJybeam-1 at 1384 and 2368 MHz, respectively. We also use the angular distribution of the total intensity of archival 330 MHz Very Large Array and the total intensity and polarized emission of our new 1384 and 2368 MHz data to constrain the diffusion coefficient for transport of the parent hadronic CRs into the dense core of Sgr B2 to be no larger than about 1% of that in the Galactic disk. Finally, we have also used the data to perform a spectral and morphological study of the features of the Sgr B cloud and compare and contrast these to previous studies.},

With the exception of Sgr B2, the flux in the compact sources is only a small percentage of that in the extended components. There is an unusual concentration of compact sources near l 0.2 deg, which in general do not coincide with the ridge of the well-known spur or arc component seen on single-dish maps. The component MD5 in Sgr B2 has a turn-over frequency no less than 8 GHz and is one of the densest HII regions in the Galaxy. A previously unrecognized shell source, G359.1-0.5, may be a supernova remnant. Supplementary observations at Westerbork provide a limit of 10 Jy for the flux density of Sgr A West at 610 MHz, which confirms that the electron temperature of the HII region surrounding the galactic nucleus is not out of the ordinary.},

@article{Mehringer:1995aa,
	Abstract = {Observations of the 6 cm transition of H2CO (formaldehyde) toward the Sgr B massive star-forming complex have been carried out using the Very Large Array (VLA). The purpose of this 15 sec resolution absorption study was to determine the parameters (e.g., velocities, optical depths, and line widths) of the molecular clouds that lie along the line of sight. The H2CO clouds studied have velocities in the range -130 km/s less than vLSR less than +130 km/s. The H2CO spectrum of Sgr B1 is very different from that of Sgr B2. The optical depths of the molecular clouds associated with Sgr B2 are greater than 1, while the opacities are less than 1 for the molecular clouds associated with Sgr B1. Thus, much of the molecular material in Sgr B1 seems to have dispersed, suggesting that Sgr B1 is more evolved than Sgr B2. This same conclusion was reached by Mehringer et al. on the basis of radio continuum observations. In Sgr B2, H2CO spectra vary dramatically from one position to another, which suggests that the H II regions lie at different depths within the clouds. Thus, several isolated events may have triggered star formation throughout Sgr B2, in contrast to many current models which suggest a single global event is responsible. The properties of a number of clouds which are in the central part of the Galaxy, but are not associated with the H II regions, are briefly discussed.},

It is likely that the H I absorption line is produced mainly within the massive molecular envelope surrounding the dense Sgr B2 cores; if so, the Blos we measure is that of the Sgr B2 molecular cloud complex. Maps of the plane-of-sky magnetic field direction from polarized emission of dust have led others to suggest that the present north-south elongation of the Sgr B2 cloud was due to infall along the predominantly east-west oriented magnetic field lines. Our measured magnetic field strength is approximately equal to the critical magnetic field required to support the entire cloud complex against gravitational collapse and thus provides support for this picture. Ambipolar diffusion heating may explain the high gas temperatures in the Sgr B2 cloud.},

	Abstract = {We present a wide-field, high dynamic range, high-resolution, long-wavelength (lambda=90 cm) VLA image of the Galactic center region. The image is centered on Sgr A, covers an area of 4degx5deg with an angular resolution of 43", and has a rms sensitivity of ~5 mJy beam-1. The image was constructed from archival (1989 and 1991) VLA data of Pedlar et al. and Anantharamaiah et al. using new three-dimensional image restoration techniques. These three-dimensional imaging techniques resolve the problem of non-coplanar baselines encountered at long wavelengths and yield distortion-free imaging of far-field sources with improved sensitivity. At lambda=90 cm the VLA is sensitive to both thermal and nonthermal emission and the resulting image gives an unprecedented contextual perspective of the large-scale radio structure in this unique and complicated region. We have catalogued over a hundred sources from this image and present for each source its 90 cm flux density, position, and size. For many of the small- diameter sources, we also derive the 20/90 cm spectral index. The spectral index as a function of length along several of the isolated nonthermal filaments has been estimated and found to be constant. We have found six new small-diameter sources, as well as several extended regions of emission, which are clearly distinct sources that have not been previously identified at higher frequencies. These data are presented as a first epoch of VLA observations that can be used to search for source variability in conjunction with a second epoch of observations that were recently initiated.},

For many astrophysical studies, it is essential to bring `both worlds' together by combining information over a wide range of spatial frequencies. This lecture demonstrates the effects of missing short-spacings, and discusses two main issues: (a) how to provide missing short-spacings to interferometric data, and (b) how to combine short-spacing single-dish data with those from an interferometer.},

	Abstract = {New low-frequency 74 and 330 MHz observations of the Galactic center (GC) region reveal the presence of a large-scale (6deg×2deg) diffuse source of nonthermal synchrotron emission. A minimum-energy analysis of this emission yields a total energy of ~(phi4/7f3/7)×1052 ergs and a magnetic field strength of ~6(phi/f)2/7 muG (where phi is the proton to electron energy ratio and f is the filling factor of the synchrotron emitting gas). The equipartition particle energy density is 1.2(phi/f)2/7 eV cm-3, a value consistent with cosmic-ray data. However, the derived magnetic field is several orders of magnitude below the 1 mG field commonly invoked for the GC. With this field the source can be maintained with the supernova rate inferred from the GC star formation. Furthermore, a strong magnetic field implies an abnormally low GC cosmic-ray energy density. We conclude that the mean magnetic field in the GC region must be weak, of order 10 muG (at least on size scales >~125").},

	Abstract = {The source of Galactic cosmic rays (with energies up to 1015eV) remains unclear, although it is widely believed that they originate in the shock waves of expanding supernova remnants. At present the best way to investigate their acceleration and propagation is by observing the gamma-rays produced when cosmic rays interact with interstellar gas. Here we report observations of an extended region of very-high-energy (> 1011eV) gamma-ray emission correlated spatially with a complex of giant molecular clouds in the central 200 parsecs of the Milky Way. The hardness of the gamma-ray spectrum and the conditions in those molecular clouds indicate that the cosmic rays giving rise to the gamma-rays are likely to be protons and nuclei rather than electrons. The energy associated with the cosmic rays could have come from a single supernova explosion around 104 years ago.},

	Abstract = {The Galactic Center region is obviously the most nearby core of a galaxy and is subject to extreme physical conditions, e.g., it contains the most nearby massive black hole Sgr A* and the very prominent star forming region Sgr B2. We present results of a high-resolution, wide-field, multi-line ammonia survey of the Galactic Center region obtained with he Australia Telescope Compact Array. The survey encompasses Sgr A* and Sgr B2 within its 1 degree x 0.2 degree field of view. At a resolution of  1pc, this is the most detailed map of molecular gas across the Galactic Center region to date. The inversion transitions of ammonia are an excellent thermometer of molecular gas and we derive mean kinetic temperatures of  50K with higher temperatures in some clouds near Sgr A* and in Sgr B2. A very prominent temperature gradient stretches across Sgr B2 (ranging from  100 to  30K), with high temperatures away from the Galactic Center. A decomposition in individual molecular clouds reveals about 3000 individual complexes. The decomposition is used to derive the clump mass function which is flatter than in other Galactic star forming regions. The very high velocity dispersions and the relatively high temperatures also lead to considerable P/k overpressures of  10^6-9 K cm-3.},

	Abstract = {The radio complex Sgr B region was observed with the X-ray Imaging Spectrometer (XIS) on board Suzaku. This region exhibits diffuse iron lines at 6.4, 6.7, and 6.9keV, which are Kalpha lines of Fe I (neutral iron), Fe XXV (He-like iron), and Fe XXVI (H-like iron), respectively. The high energy resolving power of the XIS provided separate maps of the K-shell transition lines from Fe I (6.4keV) and Fe XXV (6.7keV). Although the 6.7keV line is smoothly distributed over the Sgr B region, a local excess is found near (l, b) = (0.$\,^{\circ}$61,0.$\,^{\circ}$01), possibly due to a new SNR. The plasma temperature is kT˜ 3 keV and the age is estimated to be younger than 7 × 103 yr. The 6.4keV image is clumpy with local excesses near Sgr B2 and at (l, b) = (0.$\,^{\circ}$74,-0.$\,^{\circ}$09). Like Sgr B2, this excess may be another candidate of an X-ray reflection nebula.},

	Abstract = {It is believed that the observed diffuse gamma-ray emission from the galactic plane is the result of interactions between cosmic rays and the interstellar gas. Such emission can be amplified if cosmic rays penetrate into dense molecular clouds. The propagation of cosmic rays inside a molecular cloud has been studied assuming an arbitrary energy and space dependent diffusion coefficient. If the diffusion coefficient inside the cloud is significantly smaller compared to the average one derived for the galactic disk, the observed gamma-ray spectrum appears harder than the cosmic ray spectrum, mainly due to the slower penetration of the low energy particles towards the core of the cloud. This may produce a great variety of gamma-ray spectra.},

	Abstract = {Using the Mopra telescope, we have undertaken a 3-mm spectral-line imaging survey of a 5 × 5 arcmin2 area around Sgr B2. We covered almost the complete spectral range from 81.7 to 113.5 GHz, with 2.2 MHz wide spectral channels or ~6 kms -1 and have observed 24 lines, with 0.033 MHz wide, or ~0.1kms -1 channels. We discuss the distribution of around 50 lines, and present velocity-integrated emission images for 38 of the lines. In addition, we have detected around 120 more lines, mostly concentrated at the particularly spectral-line-rich Sgr B2(N) source.  There are significant differences in molecular emission, pointing to both abundance and excitation differences throughout the region. Seven distinct spatial locations are identified for the emitting species, including peaks near the prominent star-forming cores of Sgr B2(N), (M) and (S) that are seen in infrared (IR)-to-radio continuum images. The other features are a `north ridge' and a `north cloud' to the north of the Sgr B2 N-M-S cores, a `south-east peak' and a `west ridge'.  The column density, as evident through C18O, peaks at the Sgr B2(N) and (M) cores, where strong absorption is also evident in otherwise generally bright lines such as HCO+, HCN and HNC. Most molecules trace a ridge line to the west of the Sgr B2 N-M-S cores, wrapping around the cores and extending north-east to the north cloud. This is most clearly evident in the species HC3N, CH3CN, CH3OH and OCS. They are found to be closer in distribution to the cooler dust traced by the submillimetre continuum than either the warmer dust seen in the mid-IR or to the radio continuum.

The 3.5 and 6 cm surveys are the most sensitive and highest resolution single-dish surveys made of the central degrees of our Galaxy. We present catalogs of compact and extended sources in the central 4$\,^{\circ}$ of our Galaxy, including detailed spectral index studies of all sources. The analysis covers star-forming regions such as Sgr B and Sgr C, where we find evidence of a mixture of thermal and nonthermal emission. The analysis quantifies the relative contribution of thermal and nonthermal processes to the radio continuum flux density toward the Galactic center (GC) region. In the central 4$\,^{\circ}$ × 1$\,^{\circ}$ of the GC, the thermal and nonthermal flux fractions for all compact and diffuse sources are 28%/72% at 3.5 cm and 19%/81% at 6 cm. The total flux densities from these sources are 783 +/- 52 and 1063 +/- 93 Jy at 3.5 and 6 cm, respectively, excluding the contribution of Galactic synchrotron emission.},

	Abstract = {Recent ammonia (1,1) inversion line data on the Galactic star-forming region Sgr B2 show that the column density is consistent with a radial Gaussian density profile with a standard deviation of 2.75 pc. Deriving a formula for the virial mass of spherical Gaussian clouds, we obtain Mvir = 1.9 × 106Msolar for Sgr B2. For this matter distribution, a reasonable magnetic field and an impinging flux of cosmic rays of solar neighbourhood intensity, we predict the expected synchrotron emission from the Sgr B2 giant molecular cloud due to secondary electrons and positrons resulting from cosmic-ray interactions, including effects of losses due to pion production collisions during diffusive propagation into the cloud complex.  We assemble radio-continuum data at frequencies between 330 MHz and 230 GHz. From the spectral-energy distribution, the emission appears to be thermal at all frequencies. Before using these data to constrain the predicted synchrotron flux, we first model the spectrum as free-free emission from the known ultra compact HII regions plus emission from an envelope or wind with a radial-density gradient, and obtain an excellent fit. We thus find the spectrum at all frequencies to be dominated by thermal emission, and this severely constrains the possible synchrotron emission by secondary electrons to quite low-flux levels. The absence of a significant contribution by secondary electrons is almost certainly due to multi-GeV energy cosmic rays being unable to penetrate far into giant molecular clouds. This would also explain why 100 MeV-GeV gamma-rays (from neutral pion decay or bremsstrahlung by secondary electrons) were not observed from Sgr B2 by the EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma Ray Observatory, while TeV energy gamma-rays were observed by the High Energy Stereoscopic System (HESS), being produced by higher energy cosmic rays which more readily penetrate giant molecular clouds.},

	Abstract = {We report radio continuum observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array of two molecular clouds. The impetus for these observations is a search for synchrotron radiation by cosmic-ray secondary electrons/positrons in a region of enhanced density and possibly high magnetic field. We present modelling which shows that there should be an appreciable flux of synchrotron above the more diffuse, galactic synchrotron background. The starless core G333.125-0.562 and infrared source IRAS15596-5301 were observed at 1384 and 2368 MHz. For G333.125-0.562, we find no significant levels of radio emission from this source at either frequency, nor any appreciable polarisation: we place an upper limit on the radio continuum flux from this source of 0.5 mJy beam-1 at both 1384 and 2368 MHz. Due to the higher than expected flux density limits, we also obtained archival ATCA data at 8640 MHz for this cloud and place an upper limit on the flux density of 50 muJy beam-1. Assuming the cosmic ray spectrum is similar to that near the Sun and given the cloud's molecular density and mass, we place an upper limit on the magnetic field of 500 muG. IRAS 15596-5301, with an RMS of 50 muJy beam-1 at 1384 MHz, shows an HII region consistent with optically thin free-free emission already detected at 4800 MHz. We use the same prescription as G333 to constrain the magnetic field from this cloud to be less than 500 muG. We find that these values are not inconsistent with the view that magnetic field values scale with the average density of the molecular cloud.},

@phdthesis{Jones:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Despite many years of research dedicated to elucidating the conditions in which cosmic rays (CRs) are accelerated, there is still great uncertainty about exactly how such particles are accelerated up to energies of 1 TeV (1 TeV= 10? eV) and well beyond. Additionally, there is also great uncertainty about the structure and amplitude of the Galactic magnetic field which necessarily has a great impact upon the movement and interaction of CRs in the Galaxy. This thesis deals with a number of ways in which Gigahertz (GHz) frequency radio continuum observations can be used with GeV gamma-ray observations to explore (i) the CR spectrum and (ii) the magnetic field amplitude in the Galaxy. An accurate knowledge of the CR spectrum and amplitude of the magnetic field has important consequences for a wide range of phenomena, such as particle acceleration and even star formation within the Galaxy. We present a simple static, single-zone model of secondary electron and positron production from CR protons and heavier nuclei interacting with ambient matter. We then apply this model, assuming a local CR spectrum, to predict the synchrotron emission from two cold, dense, massive molecular cores which are relatively nearby using a prescription for the magnetic field which scales as the (approximate) square-root of the hydrogen number density. Radio continuum observations with the Australia Telescope Compact Array (ATCA) are then used to search for this emission and, due to the lack of detection, upper limits to the magnetic fields within these cores are obtained. We find that these limits are not inconsistent with the prescription used in the theoretical modeling. We also present observations of a giant molecular cloud located in the Galactic centre (GC) region, Sagittarius B2 (Sgr B2), chosen because of the expectation of a higher CR flux (than that observed at the top of the earth's atmosphere). Based on previous work, the simple model presented in this thesis is then extended to include effects of CR diffusion into the Sgr B2 cloud parameterized by a "diffusion transport suppression" factor (and based on a molecular distribution - obtained from NH? spectral line emission studies - that can modeled as a three-dimensional Gaussian distribution). Our results show that the complex nature of the environment severely hampers the separation of the thermal and non-thermal emission so that no spectral, polarized or morphological evidence is found for non-thermal emission due to secondary electrons and positrons. Analysis of the radial brightness distribution from the centre of the main complex of Sgr B2 allowed us to place limits on the diffusion of GeV energy CRs into the cloud. This leads to a relative deficit of CRs at the centre of the cloud and a morphology which is reminiscent of a "limb-brightening" of synchrotron emission from secondary electrons and positrons. This is in contrast to to the TeV energy gamma-rays from which a good correlation with molecular matter in the GC region is observed. This is interpreted by us as evidence of the exclusion of GeV energy CRs from the densest molecular environments in this region, whilst the TeV (or higher) CRs are able to freely penetrate these regions leading to the gamma-ray -molecular line emission correlation observed by the HESS telescopes. Serendipitously, observations of this region uncovered evidence of non-thermal emission from a source to the south of the main complex of emission within Sgr B2. Analysis of archival XMM-Newton X-ray observations revealed an X-ray source located approximately 20" from the non-thermal radio source whose spectrum is strongly suggestive of a SNR. The non-thermal radio spectrum, X-ray source and spectrum were then used in concert with NH3 line emission to argue that this source is a SNR of approximately 3000 years of age which had exploded in this dense region. A large gradient in the NH? line emission towards the X-ray source suggests that any SNR shell would expand towards this region of lower density. Analysis of higher resolution 1720 MHz ATCA data revealed a weak source whose extension is coincident with the X-ray source. Finally, the observations of the Sgr B2 region were then expanded to explore the nature of the magnetic field amplitude on large scales in the region, of which there is a two orders of- magnitude uncertainty. Based on earlier work, which showed a large (6$\,^{\circ}$ × 2$\,^{\circ}$) region of synchrotron emission at the GC, we assembled single-dish and interferometric observations of this region. The objective of this was to explore the possibility that a "spectral downturn" existed at GHz frequencies, which is due to the gradual dominance towards lower energies of the bremsstrahlung cooling rate over the synchrotron cooling rate. After the removal of appropriate background and the consideration of limitations at GeV and TeV energies, we found significant statistical evidence for a spectral break at ~ 2 GHz, which implies a magnetic field amplitude of 100 muG in a density of ~ 100 cm - . An amplitude this high, on such large scales will have a large impact on processes such as particle acceleration, star-formation and gas-dynamics in the region.},

We model nonthermal particle and photon spectra for the hidden SNR in the open cluster Westerlund 2, and the old-age mixed-morphology SNR W 28. We assume that the SNR shock propagates in a low-density cavity, which is created and heated through the activities of the progenitor stars and/or previous supernova explosions. We indicate that the diffusion coefficient for cosmic rays around the SNRs is less than ~1% of that away from them. We compare our predictions with the gamma-ray spectra of molecular clouds illuminated by the cosmic rays (Fermi and H.E.S.S.). We found that the spectral indices of the particles are ~2.3. This may be because the particles were accelerated at the end of the Sedov phase, and because energy-dependent escape and propagation of particles did not much affect the spectrum.},

@article{Crocker:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The amplitude of the magnetic field near the Galactic Centre has been uncertain by two orders of magnitude for several decades. On a scale of ~100 parsecs (pc), fields of ~1,000 microgauss (muG refs 1-3) have been reported, implying a magnetic energy density more than 10,000 times stronger than typical for the Galaxy. Alternatively, the assumption of pressure equilibrium between the various phases of the Galactic Centre interstellar medium (including turbulent molecular gas, the contested `very hot' plasma, and the magnetic field) suggests fields of ~100 muG over ~400 pc size scales. Finally, assuming equipartition, fields of only ~6 muG have been inferred from radio observations for 400 pc scales. Here we report a compilation of previous data that reveals a downward break in the region's non-thermal radio spectrum (attributable to a transition from bremsstrahlung to synchrotron cooling of the in situ cosmic-ray electron population). We show that the spectral break requires that the Galactic Centre field be at least ~50 muG on 400 pc scales, lest the synchrotron-emitting electrons produce too much gamma-ray emission, given other existing constraints. Other considerations support a field of 100 muG, implying that over 10% of the Galaxy's magnetic energy is contained in only <~0.05% of its volume.},

@article{Mauerhan:2010aa,
	Abstract = {We present new identifications of infrared counterparts to the population of hard X-ray sources near the Galactic center detected by the Chandra X-ray Observatory. We have spectroscopically confirmed 16 new massive stellar counterparts to the X-ray population, including nitrogen-type (WN) and carbon-type (WC) Wolf-Rayet stars, and O supergiants. These discoveries increase the total sample of massive stellar X-ray sources in the Galactic center region to 30 (possibly 31). For the majority of these sources, the X-ray photometry is consistent with thermal emission from plasma having temperatures in the range of kT = 1-8 keV or non-thermal emission having power-law indices in the range of -1 <~ Gamma <~ 3, and X-ray luminosities in the range of L X ~ 1032-1034 erg s-1 (0.5-8.0 keV). Several sources have exhibited X-ray variability of several factors between observations. These X-ray properties are not a ubiquitous feature of single massive stars but are typical of massive binaries, in which the high-energy emission is generated by the collision of supersonic winds, or by accretion onto a compact companion. However, without direct evidence for companions, the possibility of intrinsic hard X-ray generation from single stars cannot be completely ruled out. The spectral energy distributions of these sources exhibit significant infrared excess, attributable to free-free emission from ionized stellar winds, supplemented by hot dust emission in the case of the WC stars. With the exception of one object located near the outer regions of the Quintuplet cluster, most of the new stars appear isolated or in loose associations. Seven hydrogen-rich WN and O stars are concentrated near the Sagittarius B H II region, while other similar stars and more highly evolved hydrogen-poor WN and WC stars lie scattered within ≈50 pc, in projection, of Sagitarrius A West. We discuss various mechanisms capable of generating the observed X-rays and the implications these stars have for massive star formation in the Galaxy's Central Molecular Zone.},

Comparison with the observed near-infrared absorption spectrum in the BN object shows that no single type of these particles can adequately account for the observed 9.8 micron feature, and that a mixture of various types of silicates may be required. Fits to the relative strengths of the observed ice and silicate features give mantle-to-core volume ratios from 0.3 to 1.3. The emission efficiency at wavelengths above 100 microns is found to be sensitive to the presence of an ice mantle with the silicate grains in inverse proportion to the square of the wavelength, while the core-mantle grains follow an inverse cube law. Upper limits to the enhancement of the far-infrared emissivity due to impurities are deduced, and it is found that only core-mantle grains can reasonably account for the observed far-infrared luminosities of many H II regions.},

	Abstract = {Molecular hydrogen in interstellar clouds absorbs ultraviolet radiation in lines of the Lyman and Werner systems. The subsequent fluorescence leads to dissociation or to the population of excited rotational-vibrational levels of the ground electronic state. The rotational-vibrational levels decay by means of quadrupole transitions which result in the emission of infrared photons and the population of excited rotational levels of the lowest vibrational state. An additional input into the cascade is provided by the formation of molecules on grain surfaces. A concise tabular description of the rotation-vibration cascade is presented. Calculations of the infrared emission spectrum of H2 are given for an illustrative cloud model which includes the processes of fluorescence and hot molecule formation. In favorable circumstances, some of the infrared lines may have detectable intensities. Due to the distribution of lines, it may prove possible to detect interstellar H2 using narrow-band filter photometry at a wavelength of 2.4 microns.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents interstellar H I column densities, mean H I space densities, total neutral hydrogen column densities, and total mean hydrogen space densities toward 100 stars surveyed in the L-alpha region with the U2 detector of the Copernicus satellite. The data for 47 stars are compared with OAO 2 results, and ratios of gas to E(B-V) color excess are computed for 30 'intercloud' stars, 45 'cloud' stars, and the combined sample of 75 stars. A definitive value of 5.8 x 10 to the 21st power atoms/sq cm per mag is obtained for the mean ratio of total neutral hydrogen to color excess, indicating that this ratio seems to be a constant, independent of location in the sky, except possibly toward stars with anomalous extinction. The anomalous ratio determined for Rho Oph is examined, and the galactic distribution of neutral hydrogen is evaluated. The following values are estimated for matter in the galactic plane within 500 pc of the sun: a total mean hydrogen space density of 1.15 atoms/cu cm, a mean H2 space density of 0.143 molecule/cu cm (possibly a lower limit), and a mean H I space density of 0.86 atom/cu cm (a possible overestimate).},

Following Sellgren (1984), the transient heating of very small grains to a peak temperature of about 1000 K by the absorption of a single UV photon is considered, and the subsequent IR emission is estimated. It is shown that graphite is one of the few solids that would not sublime under such conditions, and that the stretching modes of the CH radicals resulting from the conditions give an excellent fit to the observed 3.28 micron emission band. It is demonstrated that bulk graphite optical constants are inadequate for small carbon clusters due to a size effect. The expected emission of coronene, a medium-sized polycyclic aromatic molecule, heated to an average temperature of 600 K is computed and the spectral features are found to be in impressive agreement with most of the observed emission bands.},

A homogenized system is proposed, based on the systems of Glass (1984) and Johnson et al. (1966). The homogenized data sets are used to derive intrinsic colors for a number of giants and dwarfs. The passbands of several IR systems are estimated and the synthetic colors of the systems are compared using blackbody and stellar fluxes. The passbands were adjusted in wavelength to produce agreement with observed relations between different systems, making it possible to estimate the effective wavelengths of the different natural systems.},

H-76 alpha recombination line profiles are obtained for six sources using a 4.4 arcsec beam. It is shown that these UC H II regions have electron densities of at least approximately 10,000 per cubic cm, emission measures of at least approximately 10 to the 7th pc cm to the -6th, and diameters no more than approximately 0.1 pc, consistent with their being small photoionized nebulae produced by O and B stars embedded in clouds of molecular gas and dust. At high angular resolution five different morphologies of the ionized gas are seen: spherical or unresolved (43 percent), cometary (20 percent), core-halo (16 percent), shell (4 percent), and irregular or multiply peaked (17 percent). Evidence is presented that the UC H II region phase of a massive star must last for a significant fraction of its main-sequence lifetime.},

The grains are assumed to include a substantial proportion of vacuum along with solid particles. The optical properties of the composite grains are calculated with the approximate 'Bruggeman mixing rule', and the extinction of the grain is calculated wih standard Mie theory. The derived cross sections are close to those of hollow spheres in which the constituents occupy the proper volume fractions, and the derived optical constants of the mixture also obey the Kramers-Kroenig relations. The calculated interstellar extinction law shows reasonable agreement with observations of the diffuse ISM over the 1500-0.12 micron wavelength range. The predicted albedo is 0.5-0.6. It is predicted that the visual extinction per H nucleus should increase slightly with R(V).},

	Abstract = {Comet-shaped H II regions, like G34.3 + 0.2, are easily explained as bow shocks created by wind-blowing massive stars moving supersonically through molecular clouds. The required velocities of the stars through dense clumps are less than about 10 km/s, comparable to the velocity dispersion of stars in OB associations. An analytic model of bow shocks matches the gross characteristics seen in the radio continuum and the velocity structure inferred from hydrogen recombination and molecular line observations. The champagne flow model cannot account for these structures. VLBI observations of masers associated with the shells of cometary compact H II regions should reveal tailward proper motions predominantly parallel to the shell, rather than perpendicular. It is predicted that over a decade baseline, high signal-to-noise VLA observations of this class of objects will show headward pattern motion in the direction of the symmetry axis, but not expansion. Finally, shock-generated and coronal infrared lines are also predicted.},

The algorithm achieves the maximum correlation between adjacent pixels, i.e., the smoothest image, consistent with the data and data uncertainties. For high spatial data density and signal-to-noise ratio, the achievable spatial resolution can exceed the diffraction limit of the optics. The capability of the algorithm is illustrated using 60-micron data from the region centered on the galaxy M101, obtained during the all-sky survey performed by the Infrared Astronomical Satellite. The 60-micron map produced has a resolution of about 36 arcsec and allows the identification of many H II regions by position and aperture photometry for the brighter ones. The achieved resolution is discussed in terms of the a priori estimate of the mean correlation length of the data, the directly measured FWHM in the final image, and the results of aperture photometry of M101 H II regions NGC 5447, 5455, 5461, 5462 and 5471.},

The cloud is shown to be optically thin at wavelengths longer than 150 microns, so the sub-mm fluxes can be used to estimate the total dust mass, which is found to be 2400 solar masses. The total FIR luminosity of the cloud is found to be 27 million solar luminosities, making W49A one of the most luminous star-forming regions in the Galaxy.

To do this, the equilibrium shape of the wind-blown shell is calculated, assuming momentum conservation. Then the shell is illuminated with ionizing radiation from the central star, radiative transfer for free-free emission through the shell is performed, and the resulting object is visualized at various angles for comparison with radio continuum maps. The model unifies most of the observed morphologies of ultracompact H II regions, excluding only those objects with spherical shells. Ram pressure confinement greatly lengthens the life of ultracompact H II regions, explaining the large number that exist in the Galaxy despite their low apparent kinematic ages.},

A sample of 260 sources was selected from the IRAS Point Source Catalog, following the color selection criteria suggested by Richards et al.

Twelve new maser sources were found, all characterized by rather low integrated fluxes and narrow components. On the basis of FIR color indices and the maser detection rates, and from a comparison with other classes of objects, it is suggested that the sources included in the sample not associated with ultracompact H II regions contain a high fraction of candidate molecular clouds with embedded high mass protostars still in the accretion phase.},

The location of each of these young stellar objects on the diagram is determined to a large extent by its evolutionary state. The pattern of colors displayed by classical T Tauri stars with near-infrared excesses can be reproduced very well with standard circumstellar disk models. But standard disk models cannot account for the large infrared excesses and the distribution of AeBe stars unless (1) models contain central holes and (2) the physical parameters of the disks and central stars always conspire to produce temperatures in the narrow range between 2000-3000 K at the inner edges of the disks. The fact that this temperature range is near the sublimation temperature of interstellar dust suggests that dust is the primary source of opacity at infrared wavelengths in circumstellar disks around AeBe stars.},

	Abstract = {We calculate numerically the structure and evolution of pre-main-sequence stars with masses from 1 to 6 Msun. These stars are assumed to originate from protostars accreting within molecular clouds. For masses from 2 to 4 Msun, the stellar luminosity first increases markedly during a protracted epoch of nonhomologous contraction and thermal relaxation. Deuterium burns in a subsurface shell throughout this period. More massive objects are thermally relaxed from the start; they contract homologously, with fully radiative interiors. Stars with masses greater then 8 Msun have no pre-main-sequence phase, since they are already burning hydrogen by the time protostellar accretion has ended. We summarize our results by presenting a new set of evolutionary tracks in the H-R diagram.  Our calculations imply that Herbig Ae and Be stars are substantially younger than previously believed. The upper boundary to their distribution in the H-R diagram is well matched by our theoretical birthline. The presence in these stars of emission lines and strong winds is not linked to an outer convection zone, since our models show that such convection always vanishes with rising effective temperature. Finally, while residual accretion from circumstellar disks may be occurring, we argue that the associated mass transfer rates are not high enough to account for the stars' observed infrared excesses.},

No a proiri clump profile is assumed.

Blending of clump emission leads to small errors in mass and size determinations and in severe cases can result in a number of clumps being misidentified as a single unit, flattening the measured clump mass spectrum. The algorithm is applied to two real data sets as an example of its use. The Rosette molecular cloud is a 'typical' star-forming cloud, but in the Maddalena molecular cloud high-mass star formation is completely absent. Comparison of the two clump lists generated by the algorithm show that on a one-to-one basis the clumps in the star-forming cloud have higher peak temperatures, higher average densities, and are more gravitationally bound than in the non-star-forming cloud. Collective properties of the clumps, such as temperature-size-line-width-mass relations appear very similar, however. Contrary to the initial results reported in a previous paper (Williams & Blitz 1993), we find that the current, more thoroughly tes ted analysis finds no significant difference in the clump mass spectrum of the two clouds.},

	Abstract = {Near-infrared photometry in the J, H and K bands is increasingly employed to identify young stars, still deeply embedded. But when can a star be reliably differentiated from a shock? The infrared colours of molecular shocks are calculated here, summing over the many contributing lines of vibrationally-excited molecular hydrogen, combined with appropriate filters, reddening and fast-shock iron-line emission. Simulated spectral templates are also presented from which H_2_ lines and bands useful as diagnostics are specified. The intrinsic infrared colours of shocks are easily recognised with a particularly faint H-band. Embedded (reddened) shocks, however, possess similar colours to extreme Class I sources. It is concluded that for strong 'infrared-excess' sources the colour-colour diagram alone does not provide sufficient information to exclude a shock.},

In a volume of less than a cubic light year, three luminous hydrogen-rich WNL+abs stars cohabit with six O3 stars [including two O3 III (f*)] and other early O stars; RD 97950 is therefore the densest concentration of very massive stars known in the Galaxy. The close physical association between O3 and WNL + abs stars, as well as the evolution of spectroscopic features, suggests a direct evolutionary link between them. The total output of Lyman continuum photons from these 14 stars alone accounts for more than 80% of what is required to ionize the surrounding nebula. The very small radius of the wind-driven bubble surrounding RD 97950 seems at odds with the tremendous power, LW ˜3.2 × 1038 erg s-1, supplied by massive stars to the nebula.},

Spectral indices near 3 mm are alpha = -0.31 + 0.03 and -0.2 t 0.2 for Sgr B2(N') and Sgr B2(W), respectively, and are attributed to the optically thin free-free emission. Free-free emission contributes significantly to the 3 mm continuum in Sgr B2(M), but the positive slope of the continuum spectrum (alpha = 1.0 + 0.3) indicates the presence of dust grains. Sgr B2(N) is dominated by thermal dust emission with a steep spectral index alpha = 4.6 + 0.5. The 3 mm continuum spectra yield the grain emissivity exponents fl = 1.7 + 1.3 and 3.7 + 0.7 for Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N), respectively. The grain emissivity law derived for Sgr B2(N) is significantly higher than most for other molecular clouds. Thus Sgr B2(N) appears to be a very unusual dust core. The most likely explanation is that the region contains ice-coated core-mantle grains. The existence of ice-coated core-mantle grains implies the mean dust temperature in the Sgr B2(N) dust core is less than 150 K. The short lifetime of the core-mantle phase and the high value of n _{2 }indicate that Sgr B2(N) is quite young and in a very early stage of star formation.},

	Abstract = {We present 2 mum (K band) spectra of 180 well-studied, optically visible, luminous stars. Most of the stars are of OB spectral type, but we have also included a number of Oe and Be stars, OBN and OBC stars, cool hypergiant stars, and high-mass X-ray binary stars. Our aim in studying normal OB stars is to develop an empirical relationship between 2 mum spectral features of these massive stars and their stellar temperature and luminosity. We find the system of lines between 2.0 and 2.2 mum is particularly good for differentiating the early- and mid-O type stars. In the late-O and early-B stars, differentiation becomes more difficult, as the features show only moderate changes. We have developed a spectral classification system for the K band to be used to estimate effective temperatures of 0 and early-B stars. We demonstrate that K-band spectroscopy is superior in estimating the temperature of hot, luminous stars than the traditional methods of using infrared or even optical photometric colors alone. The only requirements are that adequate resolution (R > 1000) and signal-to-noise (S/N ˜70) be achieved. With our classification system, stars behind large amounts of visible extinction, such as in young, heavily reddened H II regions throughout our Galaxy, may be identified and studied for the first time through 2 mum spectroscopy.  Emission lines are commonly seen in the K-band spectra of supergiant stars, however, the OBN super-giants, which have a higher ratio of some processed materials at their surface, may be more likely to show line emission, especially the He I singlet transition at 2.058 mum. This has led us to propose an evolutionary scenario for some of the Galactic center He I emission-line stars, which evokes rotational mixing (Maeder 1987; Langer 1992) to explain both the strong line emission and high luminosity of these mysterious sources.  We have compared our spectroscopic database with the most recent stellar atmosphere models. We are encouraged by the good match between the model line profiles at 2 mum of Schaerer et al. (1996b) and those observed in OB stars. Finally, we include a thorough discussion of the observational and reduction methods employed to obtain the spectra shown in this atlas for the benefit of those wishing to obtain similar, classification-quality, near-infrared spectra.},

	Abstract = {In a recent survey for bow shock structures around OB runaway stars using the ISSA/IRAS archival data and excess maps at 60 \mum, 58 candidates were found. These objects are surrounded by extended infrared emission at 60 \mum, characteristic of warm dust heated by ultraviolet photons, a signature of wind bow shocks. High resolution IRAS (HiRes) images have been produced for these 58 objects and some of those spatially resolved are presented in this study. The images were used to distinguish between multiple confused IR sources, possible artifacts and unambiguous bow shocks, as the sources of the extended 60 \mum emission. Six new bow shocks have been identified using this method, and three have been rejected. Twenty two of the targets, however, remain spatially unresolved even at the nominal HiRes resolution of ~ 1arcmin . For the larger and better defined bow shocks some internal substructure is discernible. The length of these features suggest that they arise as the result of a subtle dynamical instability. It can not be ruled out, however, that some of the bow shock morphology could be imprinted by the surrounding medium.},

	Abstract = {We report on the first phase of a study of the stellar population comprising the Orion Nebula Cluster (ONC). Approximately 50% of the ~ 3500 stars identified to date within ~ 2.5 pc of the namesake Trapezium stars are optically visible, and in this paper we focus on that sample with I < 17.5 mag. The large number and number density (npeak > 10(4) pc(-3) ) of stars, the wide range in stellar mass ( ~ 0.1-50 M_&sun;), and the extreme youth (< 1-2 Myr) of the stellar population, make the ONC the best site for investigating: 1) the detailed shape of a truly ``initial'' mass spectrum; 2) the apparent age spread in a region thought to have undergone triggered star formation; 3) the time sequence of star formation as a function of stellar mass; and 4) trends of all of the above with cluster radius. Nearly 60% of the ~ 1600 optical stars have sufficient data (spectroscopy and photometry) for placement on a theoretical HR diagram; this subsample is unbiased with respect to apparent brightness or cluster radius, complete down to ~ 1 M_&sun;, and representative of the total optical sample below ~ 1 M_&sun; for the age and extinction ranges characteristic of the cluster. Comparison of the derived HR diagram with traditional pre-main sequence evolutionary calculations shows a trend of increasing stellar age with increasing stellar mass. To avoid the implication of earlier characteristic formation times for higher-mass stars than for lower-mass stars, refinement of early evolutionary theory in a manner similar to the birthline hypothesis of Palla & Stahler (1993), is required. Subject to uncertainties in the tracks and isochrones, we can still investigate stellar mass and age distributions in the ONC. We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mass spectrum which is not grossly inconsistent with ``standard'' stellar mass spectra. In particular, although there are structural differences between the detailed ONC mass spectrum and various models constructed from solar neighborhood data, the observed mass spectrum appears to a peak at ~ 0.2 M_&sun; and to fall off rapidly towards lower masses; several substellar objects are present. The abundance of low-mass stars relative to high-mass stars suggests that there is no bi-modal star formation mode; somewhat ironically, the ONC probably contains fractionally more low-mass stars than the solar neighborhood since the population not yet located on the HR diagram is dominated by sub-solar-mass stars. Nonetheless, the ONC mass spectrum is biased towards higher-mass stars within the innermost cluster radii (rprojected < 0.3 pc). We find the ONC as a whole to be characterized by a mean age of < 1 Myr and an age spread which is probably less than 2 Myr, but also by a bias towards younger stars at smaller projected cluster radii. Although the most massive stars and the youngest stars are found preferentially towards the center of the ONC it does not follow that the most massive stars are the youngest stars. A lower limit to the total cluster mass in stars is Mstars ~ 900 M_&sun; (probably a factor of < 2 underestimate). A lower limit to the recent star formation rate is ~ 10(-4) M_&sun; yr(-1) . All observational data in this study as well as stellar parameters derived from them are available in electronic format.},

@article{Meyer:1997aa,
	Abstract = {We re-examine the observed near-infrared properties of T Tauri stars and interpret them with the aid of accretion disk models. Based upon a careful analysis of the dereddened near-infrared colors, we find that T Tauri stars exhibit a surprisingly narrow range in (J-H)/(H-K) and (H-K)/(K-L) color-color diagrams. We find that accretion disk models with a range of accretion rates (10(-8) Msun yr(-1) < Mdot < 10(-6) Msun yr(-1) ), inner-disk radii (1-6 R_*), and viewing angles can account for the distribution of intrinsic near-infrared excesses. If the assumptions upon which our models are based are correct, we find that: i) the disk accretion rates needed to explain the observations are consistent with those inferred from optical spectroscopic studies; and ii) inner-disk holes are required in order to explain the range of observed intrinsic near-infrared excesses. Our model results suggest that a given near-IR excess requires a minimum disk accretion rate, though larger accretion rates can be accommodated with specific combinations of inner disk hole size and viewing inclinations. Further, we combine optical veiling measurements, knowledge of stellar SEDs and reddening, in order to estimate infrared photometric flux excesses for our sample of T Tauri stars. Assuming a distribution of mass accretion rates inferred from optical veiling studies, and a random distribution of viewing inclinations, we examine the plausible range of inner-disk hole sizes. The absence of inner-disk holes predicts near-IR excesses larger than those observed. Inner-disk holes exclusively > 8R_* are inconsistent with the observations, whereas hole sizes between 2-6 R_* are well-matched to the data. Finally we examine the impact of our results on attempts to characterize the accretion properties of embedded young star clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present a multiwavelength spectroscopic survey that reveals the ionizing cluster of M17 and uncovers a population of young stellar objects (YSOs) of high mass (M ~ 5-20 M&sun;). The masses of the stars have been determined fairly accurately through optical or near-infrared spectral classification. We find strong circumstantial evidence for disks around the massive YSOs in the following forms: near-infrared excess, optical veiling, CO band-head emission, and/or Padelta emission. We find a direct correlation between those YSOs that show CO band-head emission at 2.3 mum and those stars in our survey that show Padelta emission; in three of the four Padelta emission stars this line is double peaked (suggestive of a bipolar wind or a rotating disk or envelope). Our data suggest that circumstellar material, possibly in the form of a disk, is prevalent among very young objects of fairly high mass. Based on considerations of disk lifetimes in other young clusters, the M17 cluster appears to be very young, perhaps less than 1 Myr.  We have also identified at least nine O stars and a couple of late-O/early-B stars, most behind more than 8 mag of visible extinction using either optical or near-infrared spectral types. Several stars have inferred masses in excess of 60 M&sun;, and they look to be very close to the predicted zero-age main sequence with an estimated age of about 1 Myr, consistent with the age of the massive YSOs in the cluster. We have used the O stars to determine the distance to M17, which assumes the stars to lie on the zero-age main sequence (1300+400-200 pc). While we attempt to determine an initial mass function for the cluster, it is incomplete even at high masses because of regions of extremely high extinction (AV > 20) in the cluster. We have also used the M17 O stars to study the dust properties in the local cloud and the behavior of the diffuse interstellar bands (DIBs) along this sight line, over the extinction range of AV = 3-10. The DIBs over this extinction range show little change in spectral shape nor a significant increase in strength. We suggest the features are already saturated at small AV, or the material local to M17, where the increased extinction is being traced, does not contain the carriers of the DIB feature.},

The detection rate of the methanol masers is strongly dependent upon the IRAS colors of the sources.

	Abstract = {VLA radio continuum imaging reveals compact (<8 pc)~1 mJy radio sources in the central 5" starburst region of the blue compact galaxy Henize 2-10. While the global radio continuum spectrum is a power law (Snu~nualpha) indicative of nonthermal processes (alpha~=-0.5), the radio sources have positive (alpha>0.0) spectral indices suggesting an optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung origin. We model the luminosities and spectral energy distributions of these radio knots, finding that they are consistent with unusually dense H II regions having electron densities, 1500 cm-3<ne<5000 cm-3, and sizes 3 pc <R<8 pc. While the high inferred densities are typical of ultracompact H II regions in the Galaxy, such high optical depth (tau=0.4-3.0 at 5 GHz) at frequencies as high as 5 GHz is unusual on parsec scales in galaxies. Since these H II regions are not visible in optical images, we propose that the radio data preferentially reveal the youngest, densest, and most highly obscured star-forming events. Energy considerations imply that each of the five H II regions contains ~750 O7 V-equivalent stars, greater than the number found in 30 Doradus in the LMC. The high densities imply an overpressure compared to the typical interstellar medium, so that such objects must be short-lived (<0.5 Myr expansion timescales). We conclude that the radio continuum maps reveal the very young (<0.5 Myr) precursors of ``super-star clusters'' or ``proto-globular clusters,'' which are prominent at optical and UV wavelengths in He 2-10 and elsewhere. The fraction of O stars in these young ultradense H II regions is 15% of the total inferred O star population in Henize 2-10. This body of work leads us to propose that massive extragalactic star clusters with ages less than 106 yr, the possible precursors to globular clusters, may be most easily identified by finding compact radio sources with optically thick thermal bremsstrahlung spectral signatures.},

	Abstract = {We have completed the first extensive program of L band (3.4 mu m) imaging surveys of eight young clusters. Such clusters are likely responsible for producing most of the stars in the Galaxy. The aims of this study were (1) to determine the circumstellar disk fraction in each cluster, (2) investigate the dependence of the disk fraction on cluster age and environment, and (3) determine the disk dissipation timescale, thus providing an evaluation of the overall likelihood and conditions of planet formation in the Galaxy. The derived disk fractions in the youngest clusters lead us to suggest that the formation of disks is quite common in clusters and not dependent on environment (i.e., star formation in clusters vs. isolation). If no massive stars are present in clusters, we show that disks are not preferentially destroyed in the dense cluster environment. An examination of successively older clusters reveals that the overall disk fraction decreases with increasing cluster age. We show that the rate of the decline appears to be a function of stellar mass, with disks around massive stars having shorter lifetimes compared to disks around lower mass stars. Finally, we derive the disk dissipation timescale and discuss the implications of this timescale on the formation of planetary systems. This work was supported by a Florida Space Grant Fellowship, ISO grant #961604, NSF grant AST 9733367 to the Univ. of Florida and an ADP (WIRE) grant NAG 5-6751.},

@article{Lada:2000aa,
	Abstract = {We report the results of a sensitive near-infrared JHKL imaging survey of the Trapezium cluster in Orion. We use the JHKL colors to obtain a census of infrared excess stars in the cluster. Of (391) stars brighter than 12th magnitude in the K and L bands, 80%+/-7% are found to exhibit detectable infrared excess on the J-H, K-L color-color diagram. Examination of a subsample of 285 of these stars with published spectral types yields a slightly higher infrared excess fraction of 85%. We find that 97% of the optical proplyds in the cluster exhibit excess in the JHKL color-color diagram indicating that the most likely origin of the observed infrared excesses is from circumstellar disks. We interpret these results to indicate that the fraction of stars in the cluster with circumstellar disks is between 80%-85%, confirming earlier published suggestions of a high disk fraction for this young cluster. Moreover, we find that the probability of finding an infrared excess around a star is independent of stellar mass over essentially the entire range of the stellar mass function down to the hydrogen burning limit. Consequently, the vast majority of stars in the Trapezium cluster appear to have been born with circumstellar disks and the potential to subsequently form planetary systems, despite formation within the environment of a rich and dense stellar cluster. We identify 78 stars in our sample characterized by K-L colors suggestive of deeply embedded objects. The spatial distribution of these objects differs from that of the rest of the cluster members and is similar to that of the dense molecular cloud ridge behind the cluster. About half of these objects are detected in the short wavelength (J and H) bands, and these are found to be characterized by extreme infrared excess. This suggests that many of these sources could be protostellar in nature. If even a modest fraction (i.e., ~50%) of these objects are protostars, then star formation could be continuing in the molecular ridge at a rate comparable to that which produced the foreground Trapezium cluster.},

	Abstract = {We have carried out 21 cm radio continuum observations of 16 ultracompact H II regions using the VLA (DnC array) in a search for associated extended emission. We have also observed the H76alpha recombination line toward all the sources and the He76alpha line at the positions with strong H76alpha line emission. The UC H II regions have simple morphologies and large (>~10) ratios of single-dish to VLA fluxes. We detected extended emission toward all the sources. The extended emission consists of one to several compact (~1' or 0.5-5 pc) components and a diffuse extended (2'-12' or 4-19 pc) envelope. All the UC H II regions but two are located in the compact components, where the UC H II regions always correspond to their peaks. The compact components with UC H II regions are usually smaller and denser than those without UC H II regions. For individual sources, we derive the spectral types (O7-O4) of the ionizing stars and the fractions of UV photons absorbed by dust within the nebulae, which are significantly different from previous estimates based on the UC H II regions alone. Our recombination line observations show that the ultracompact, compact, and extended components have approximately the same velocity in the individual sources with one exception (G25.72+0.05), implying that they are physically associated. The compact components in each object appear to be ionized by separate sources, while the UC H II regions and their associated compact components are likely to be ionized by the same sources on the basis of the morphological relations mentioned above. This suggests that almost all of the observed UC H II regions are not ``real'' UC H II regions but ultracompact cores of more extended H II regions, and that their actual ages are much greater than their dynamical age (<~104 yr). We find that most of simple UC H II regions previously known have large ratios of single-dish to VLA fluxes, similar to our sources. Therefore, the ``age problem'' of UC H II regions does not seem to be as serious as earlier studies argued. We present a simple model in which the coexistence of the ultracompact, compact, and extended components for a long (>105 yr) time is easily explained by combining the champagne flow model with the hierarchical structure of massive star-forming regions. The well-known relation between the density and diameter of H II regions, ne~D-1, is a natural consequence of the hierarchical structure according to our model. We discuss some individual sources.},

	Abstract = {The Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) surveyed the entire Galactic plane within |b|<=5deg in four mid-infrared spectral bands between 6 and 25 mum at a spatial resolution of ~18.3". The survey was redundant within |b|<=4.5d with four-fold coverage over two-thirds of the area. These survey data were combined to create 1680 1.5d×1.5d images that cover the region with 6" pixel spacing in each of the spectral bands. The images preserve the inherent resolution of the data but have up to twice the sensitivity of a single scan. The individual survey observations had to be extensively conditioned to achieve the co-add advantage. The noise equivalent radiance (NER) at 8.3 mum, the most sensitive MSX mid-infrared spectral band, varies from ~1.3 MJy sr-1 in the inner Galaxy to 3 times that at the latitude limits in the outer Galaxy; the sensitivities of the other MSX mid-infrared bands are 10-25 times less. Additionally, 36 lower resolution 10deg×10deg images were generated in each band that span the full latitude and longitude range of the survey. These panoramic images have a resolution of ~1.2' with 36" pixel spacing and a six-fold improvement in NER, making them an ideal product for comparison with radio surveys of the Galactic plane. An ancillary set of images has been created from other MSX astronomy experiments that lie within 10$\,^{\circ}$ of the Galactic plane. These images either extend the latitude coverage of the survey or provide deeper probes of Galactic structure either by themselves or when added to the survey images.},

We use JHKL colors to obtain a census of the circumstellar disk fractions in each cluster. We find disk fractions of 52%+/-10%, 12%+/-4%, and 3%+/-3% for the three clusters, respectively. Together with our previously published JHKL investigations of the younger NGC 2024, Trapezium, and IC 348 clusters, we have completed the first systematic and homogeneous survey for circumstellar disks in a sample of young clusters that both span a significant range in age (0.3-30 Myr) and contain statistically significant numbers of stars whose masses span nearly the entire stellar mass spectrum. Analysis of the combined survey indicates that the cluster disk fraction is initially very high (>=80%) and rapidly decreases with increasing cluster age, such that one-half the stars within the clusters lose their disks in <~3 Myr. Moreover, these observations yield an overall disk lifetime of ~6 Myr in the surveyed cluster sample. This is the timescale for essentially all the stars in a cluster to lose their disks. This should set a meaningful constraint for the planet-building timescale in stellar clusters. The implications of these results for current theories of planet formation are briefly discussed.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of quantitative spectral analyses of ten apparently normal B-type stars. These stars were found to be young massive B-type stars at distances of z=2.6 to 7.6 kpc from the galactic plane based on their positions in the (Teff, log g) diagram, normal abundance patterns and/or large projected rotational velocities. We discuss formation scenarios (runaway star scenarios versus a scenario for star formation in the halo) by comparing times-of-flight and evolutionary time scales. For all stars (except SB 357 and HS 1914+7139) both the scales are similar indicating that the stars could have formed in the galactic disk and been ejected from there soon after their birth. Derived ejection velocities range from 130 km s-1 to 440 km s-1 and may be used to constrain models for ejection mechanisms. Using new proper motion measurements we show that PHL 346, which was considered the most likely candidate for a young B-type star born in the halo, can be explained as a runaway star from the galactic plane.

	Abstract = {We describe a systematic program aimed at identifying and characterizing candidate high-mass protostellar objects (HMPOs). Our candidate sample consists of 69 objects selected by criteria based on those established by Ramesh & Sridharan using far-infrared, radio continuum, and molecular line data. IRAS and Midcourse Space Experiment data were used to study the larger scale environments of the candidate sources and determine their total luminosities and dust temperatures. To derive the physical and chemical properties of our target regions, we observed continuum and spectral line radiation at millimeter and radio wavelengths. We imaged the free-free and dust continuum emission at wavelengths of 3.6 cm and 1.2 mm, respectively, searched for H2O and CH3OH maser emission, and observed the CO J=2-->1 line and several NH3 lines toward all sources in our sample. Other molecular tracers were observed in a subsample. While dust continuum emission was detected in all sources, most of them show only weak or no emission at 3.6 cm. Where detected, the centimeter emission is frequently found to be offset from the millimeter emission, indicating that the free-free and dust emissions arise from different subsources possibly belonging to the same (proto)cluster. A comparison of the luminosities derived from the centimeter emission with bolometric luminosities calculated from the IRAS far-infrared fluxes shows that the centimeter emission very likely traces the most massive source, whereas the whole cluster contributes to the far-infrared luminosity. Estimates of the accretion luminosity indicate that a significant fraction of the bolometric luminosity is still due to accretion processes. The earliest stages of HMPO evolution we seek to identify are represented by dust cores without radio emission. Line wings due to outflow activity are nearly omnipresent in the CO observations, and the molecular line data indicate the presence of hot cores for several sources, where the abundances of various molecular species are elevated because of evaporation of icy grain mantles. Kinetic gas temperatures of 40 sources are derived from NH3 (1,1) and (2, 2) data, and we compare the results with the dust temperatures obtained from the IRAS data. Comparing the amount of dust, and hence the gas, associated with the HMPOs and with ultracompact H II (UCH II) regions, we find that the two types of sources are clearly separated in mass-luminosity diagrams: for the same dust masses, the UCH II regions have higher bolometric luminosities than HMPOs. We suggest that this is an evolutionary trend, with the HMPOs being younger and reprocessing less (stellar) radiation in the IR than the more evolved UCH II regions. These results indicate that a substantial fraction of our sample harbors HMPOs in a pre-UCH II region phase, the earliest known stage in the high-mass star formation process.},

@article{Yorke:2002aa,
	Abstract = {We calculate numerically the collapse of slowly rotating, nonmagnetic, massive molecular clumps of masses 30, 60, and 120 Msolar, which conceivably could lead to the formation of massive stars. Because radiative acceleration on dust grains plays a critical role in the clump's dynamical evolution, we have improved the module for continuum radiation transfer in an existing two-dimensional (axial symmetry assumed) radiation hydrodynamic code. In particular, rather than using ``gray'' dust opacities and ``gray'' radiation transfer, we calculate the dust's wavelength-dependent absorption and emission simultaneously with the radiation density at each wavelength and the equilibrium temperatures of three grain components: amorphous carbon particles, silicates, and ``dirty ice''-coated silicates. Because our simulations cannot spatially resolve the innermost regions of the molecular clump, however, we cannot distinguish between the formation of a dense central cluster or a single massive object. Furthermore, we cannot exclude significant mass loss from the central object(s) that may interact with the inflow into the central grid cell. Thus, with our basic assumption that all material in the innermost grid cell accretes onto a single object, we are able to provide only an upper limit to the mass of stars that could possibly be formed. We introduce a semianalytical scheme for augmenting existing evolutionary tracks of pre-main-sequence protostars by including the effects of accretion. By considering an open outermost boundary, an arbitrary amount of material could, in principal, be accreted onto this central star. However, for the three cases considered (30, 60, and 120 Msolar originally within the computation grid), radiation acceleration limited the final masses to 31.6, 33.6, and 42.9 Msolar, respectively, for wavelength-dependent radiation transfer and to 19.1, 20.1, and 22.9 Msolar for the corresponding simulations with gray radiation transfer. Our calculations demonstrate that massive stars can in principle be formed via accretion through a disk. The accretion rate onto the central source increases rapidly after one initial free-fall time and decreases monotonically afterward. By enhancing the nonisotropic character of the radiation field, the accretion disk reduces the effects of radiative acceleration in the radial direction-a process we call the ``flashlight effect.'' The flashlight effect is further amplified in our case by including the effects of frequency-dependent radiation transfer. We conclude with the warning that a careful treatment of radiation transfer is a mandatory requirement for realistic simulations of the formation of massive stars.},

	Abstract = {Stellar clusters are born embedded within giant molecular clouds (GMCs) and during their formation and early evolution are often only visible at infrared wavelengths, being heavily obscured by dust. Over the past 15 years advances in infrared detection capabilities have enabled the first systematic studies of embedded clusters in galactic molecular clouds. In this article we review the current state of empirical knowledge concerning these extremely young protocluster systems. From a survey of the literature we compile the first extensive catalog of galactic embedded clusters. We use the catalog to construct the mass function and estimate the birthrate for embedded clusters within 2 kpc of the sun. We find that the embedded cluster birthrate exceeds that of visible open clusters by an order of magnitude or more indicating a high infant mortality rate for protocluster systems. Less than 4-7% of embedded clusters survive emergence from molecular clouds to become bound clusters of Pleiades age. The vast majority (90%) of stars that form in embedded clusters form in rich clusters of 100 or more members with masses in excess of 50 M&sun;. Moreover, observations of nearby cloud complexes indicate that embedded clusters account for a significant (70-90%) fraction of all stars formed in GMCs. We review the role of embedded clusters in investigating the nature of the initial mass function (IMF) that, in one nearby example, has been measured over the entire range of stellar and substellar mass, from OB stars to substellar objects near the deuterium burning limit. We also review the role embedded clusters play in the investigation of circumstellar disk evolution and the important constraints they provide for understanding the origin of planetary systems. Finally, we discuss current ideas concerning the origin and dynamical evolution of embedded clusters and the implications for the formation of bound open clusters.},

	Abstract = {We present a compilation of PRONAOS-based results concerning the temperature dependence of the dust submillimeter spectral index, including data from Galactic cirrus, star-forming regions, dust associated to a young stellar object, and a spiral galaxy. We observe large variations of the spectral index (from 0.8 to 2.4) in a wide range of temperatures (11 to 80 K). These spectral index variations follow a hyperbolic-shaped function of the temperature, high spectral indices (1.6-2.4) being observed in cold regions (11-20 K) while low indices (0.8-1.6) are observed in warm regions (35-80 K). Three distinct effects may play a role in this temperature dependence: one is that the grain sizes change in dense environments, another is that the chemical composition of the grains is not the same in different environments, a third one is that there is an intrinsic dependence of the dust spectral index on the temperature due to quantum processes. This last effect is backed up by laboratory measurements and could be the dominant one.},

	Abstract = {In the present paper we present JHK photometric results of the young embedded cluster NGC 2316. We construct the cluster radial profile from which we determine a radius of 0.63 pc. We find 189 $\pm$ 29 cluster members in an extinction limited sub-sample of the survey, 22$\pm$ 19 of which are possibly substellar. An average extinction of 4.5 visual magnitudes is derived using (H - K) colours of control fields. This extinction is due to the presence of residual parental molecular cloud. NGC 2316 presents 16% source fraction of excess emission which is consistent with other results from clusters with an age of 2-3 Myr. This age is consistent with the distribution of sources in the colour-magnitude diagram when compared to theoretical isochrones, and the overall shape of the cluster KLF. The substellar population of the cluster is similar or smaller than that observed for other embedded clusters and the stellar objects dominate the cluster membership.  Based on observations carried out at ESO, La Silla, Chile.},

	Abstract = {The central region of the Galaxy has been observed at 580, 620 and 1010 MHz with the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (GMRT). We detect emission from Sgr A*, the compact object at the dynamical centre of the Galaxy, and estimate its flux density at 620 MHz to be 0.5 +/- 0.1 Jy. This is the first detection of Sgr A* below 1 GHz, which along with a possible detection at 330 MHz provides its spectrum below 1 GHz. Comparison of the 620-MHz map with maps made at other frequencies indicates that most parts of the Sgr A West H II region have optical depth ~2. However, Sgr A*, which is seen in the same region in projection, shows a slightly inverted spectral index between 1010 and 620 MHz. This is consistent with its high-frequency spectral index, and indicates that Sgr A* is located in front of the Sgr A West complex, and rules out any low-frequency turnover around 1 GHz, as suggested by Davies, Walsh & Booth.},

The sources have FIR colors typical of UCHII regions and were detected in the CS(2->1) line survey of Bronfman et al. (\cite{bnm}). Regions of 15 arcmin × 10 arcmin, centered on each IRAS source, were mapped with an angular resolution of ˜24 arcsec, using the SIMBA array on the SEST telescope. 1.2 mm emission was detected toward all IRAS sources. We find that the dust cores associated with these sources have typical sizes of 0.4 pc and masses of 5× 103 M&sun;.

	Abstract = {We have observed two rotational transitions of both CS and C17O, and the 1.2 mm continuum emission towards a sample of 130 high-mass protostellar candidates with delta < -30$\,^{\circ}$. This work represents the first step of the extension to the southern hemisphere of a project started more than a decade ago aimed at the identification of massive protostellar candidates. Following the same approach adopted for sources with delta >= -30$\,^{\circ}$, we have selected from the IRAS Point Source Catalogue 429 sources which potentially are compact molecular clouds on the basis of their IR colours. The sample has then been divided into two groups according to the colour indices [25 12] and [60 12]: the 298 sources with [25 12] >= 0.57 and [60 12] >= 1.30 have been called High sources, the remaining 131 have been called Low sources. In this paper, we check the association with dense gas and dust in 130 Low sources. We have obtained a detection rate of ~85% in CS, demonstrating a tight association of the sources with dense molecular clumps. Among the sources detected in CS, ~76% have also been detected in C17O and ~93% in the 1.2 mm continuum. Millimeter-continuum maps show the presence of clumps with diameters in the range 0.2-2 pc and masses from a few M&sun; to 105 M&sun;; H2 volume densities computed from CS line ratios lie between ~104.5 and 105.5 cm-3. The bolometric luminosities of the sources, derived from IRAS data, are in the range 103-106 L&sun;, consistent with embedded high-mass objects. Based on our results and those found in the literature for other samples of high-mass young stellar objects, we conclude that our sources are massive objects in a very early evolutionary stage, probably prior to the formation of an Hii region. We propose a scenario in which High and Low sources are both made of a massive clump hosting a high-mass protostellar candidate and a nearby stellar cluster. The difference might be due to the fact that the 12 mum IRAS flux, the best discriminant between the two groups, is dominated by the emission from the cluster in Lows and from the massive protostellar object in Highs.

	Abstract = {We present a multi-epoch infrared photometric study of the intermediate-mass star-forming region G173.58+2.45. Photometric observations are obtained using the near-infrared JHKL'M' filters and narrow-band filters centred at the wavelengths of the H2 (1-0) S(1) (2.122 mum) and [FeII] (1.644 mum) lines. The H2 image shows molecular emission from shocked gas, implying the presence of multiple star formation and associated outflow activity. We see evidence for several collimated outflows. The most extended jet is at least 0.25 pc in length and has a collimation factor of ~10, which may be associated with a binary system within the central cluster, resolved for the first time here. This outflow is found to be episodic, probably occurring or being enhanced during the periastron passage of the binary. We also find that the variable star in the vicinity of the outflow source, which was known as a FU Ori-type star, is probably not a FU Ori object. It does, however, drive a spectacular outflow, and the variability is likely to be related to accretion, when large clouds of gas and dust spiral in towards the central source. Many other convincing accretion-outflow systems and YSO candidates are discovered in the field.},

Our analysis is based on neutral hydrogen (Hi) 21 cm line data, which reveal interstellar bubbles surrounding the massive stars and their optical ring nebulae. The Hi bubble related to WR 23 is 13.3 pc in radius and is expanding at 10 km s-1. The associated atomic neutral mass is 830 M_&sun;. The Hi structure related to LSS 1887 is about 6.3 pc in radius, has an expansion velocity of 7 km s-1 and an associated atomic neutral mass of 100 M_&sun;. These Hi features are the neutral counterparts of the optical ring nebulae and were mainly created by the action of the stellar winds of the massive stars on their environs. The dynamical age of the Hi bubble around WR 23 (7×105 yr) suggests that it was created during the WR phase of stellar evolution. However, the large tangential motions of WR 23 and LSS 1887 suggest that part of the observed optical and Hi structures may be due to a bow shock. The analysis of the distribution of emission in the far infrared and in the CO(1-0) molecular line in the environs of WR 23 and LSS 1887 reveals that there are also infrared and molecular counterparts of the detected Hi bubbles.},

@article{Bik:2005aa,
	Abstract = {We have obtained high resolution (R = 10 000) K-band spectra of candidate young massive stars deeply embedded in (ultra-) compact H II regions (UCHIIs). These objects were selected from a near-infrared survey of 44 fields centered on IRAS sources with UCHII colours. Often, the near-infrared counterpart of the IRAS source is a young embedded cluster hosting massive stars. In these clusters, three types of objects are identified. The first type (38 objects) consists of "naked" OB stars whose K-band spectra are dominated by photospheric emission. We classify the K-band spectra of the OB-type cluster members using near-infrared classification criteria. A few of them have a very early (O3-O4 V) spectral type, consistent with a young age of the embedded clusters. The spectral classification provides an important constraint on the distance to the embedded cluster. The ionising power of the population thus derived is compared to the information obtained from the infrared and radio flux of these sources. In most cases these two different determinations of the ionising flux are consistent, from which we conclude that we have identified the ionising star(s) in about 50% of the embedded clusters. The second type (7 objects) are point sources associated with UCHII radio emission, that exhibit nebular emission lines in the near-infrared. Six of the objects in this group produce He I emission indicative of an embedded O-type star. These objects are more embedded than the OB stars and probably do not dominate the infrared flux as measured by IRAS. They may emit the bulk of their reprocessed UV radiation at mm wavelengths. The third type (20 objects) is characterised by broad (100-200 km s-1) Brgamma emission and no photospheric absorption profiles. Bik et al. (2005, A&A, submitted) show that these objects are massive YSO candidates surrounded by dense circumstellar disks.},

	Abstract = {We report observations made with the SIMBA bolometer at SEST to measure the 1.2 mm continuum emission toward the Keyhole nebula. We have detected 1.2 mm emission toward the ionized gas filaments of the Car II radio source that is attributed to thermal free-free emission. Several compact 1.2 mm emission sources have also been identified and found to correspond to bright-rimmed molecular globules. Under the assumption that for these sources the 1.2 mm emission corresponds to dust, we find mass estimates in the range 3-19 Msolar, which are consistent with previous molecular line measurements. The data also yield new 1.2 mm flux measurements at two different epochs during the cyclic brightness variation of eta Carinae. No emission was detected toward the trademark dark keyhole of the nebula, consistent with it being cool molecular gas situated at the outskirts of the H II region.},

	Abstract = {We report the discovery of a 16th magnitude star, HE 0437-5439, with a heliocentric radial velocity of +723+/-3 km s-1. A quantitative spectral analysis of high-resolution optical spectra obtained with the VLT and UVES shows that HE 0437-5439 is a main-sequence B-type star with Teff=20,350 K, logg=3.77, a solar (within a factor of a few) helium abundance and metal content, and rotating at vsini=54 km s-1. Using appropriate evolutionary tracks, we derive a mass of 8 Msolar and a corresponding distance of 61 kpc. Its Galactic rest-frame velocity is at least 563 km s-1, almost twice the local Galactic escape velocity, indicating that the star is unbound to the Galaxy. Numerical kinematical experiments are carried out to constrain its place of birth. It has been suggested that such hypervelocity stars can be formed by the tidal disruption of a binary through interaction with the supermassive black hole at the Galactic center (GC). HE 0437-5439 needs about 100 Myr to travel from the GC to its present position, much longer than its main-sequence lifetime of 25 Myr. This can only be reconciled if HE 0437-5439 is a blue straggler star. In this case, the predicted proper motion is so small that it can only be measured by future space missions. Since the star is much closer to the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC; 18 kpc) than to the GC, it can reach its position from the center of the LMC. The proper motion predicted in this case is about 2 mas yr-1 (relative to the LMC), large enough to be measurable with conventional techniques from the ground. The LMC origin could also be tested by a high-precision abundance analysis.  Based on observations collected at the European Southern Observatory, La Silla and Paranal, Chile (proposals 68.D-0192 and 70.D-0334).},

	Abstract = {In an ongoing effort to identify and study high-mass protostellar candidates we have observed in various tracers a sample of 235 sources selected from the IRAS Point Source Catalog, mostly with delta < -30 degr, with the SEST antenna at millimeter wavelengths. The sample contains 142 Low sources and 93 High, which are believed to be in different evolutionary stages. Both sub-samples have been studied in detail by comparing their physical properties and morphologies. Massive dust clumps have been detected in all but 8 regions, with usually more than one clump per region. The dust emission shows a variety of complex morphologies, sometimes with multiple clumps forming filaments or clusters. The mean clump has a linear size of   0.5 pc, a mass of   320 M_&sun; for a dust temperature Td = 30 K, an H2 density of 9.5×105 cm-3, and a surface density of 0.4 g cm-2. The median values are 0.4 pc, 102 M_&sun;, 4×104 cm-3, and 0.14 g cm-2, respectively. The mean value of the luminosity-to-mass ratio, L/M ~= 99 L_&sun;/M_&sun;, suggests that the sources are in a young, pre-ultracompact Hii phase. We have compared the millimeter continuum maps with images of the mid-IR MSX emission, and have discovered 95 massive millimeter clumps non-MSX emitters, either diffuse or point-like, that are potential prestellar or precluster cores. The physical properties of these clumps are similar to those of the others, apart from the mass that is  3 times lower than for clumps with MSX counterpart. Such a difference could be due to the potential prestellar clumps having a lower dust temperature. The mass spectrum of the clumps with masses above M ˜ 100 M_&sun; is best fitted with a power-law dN/dM propto M-alpha with alpha = 2.1, consistent with the Salpeter (1955) stellar IMF, with alpha=2.35. On the other hand, the mass function of clumps with masses 10 M_&sun;⪅ M ⪅ 120 M_&sun; is better fitted with a power law of slope alpha = 1.5, more consistent with the mass function of molecular clouds derived from gas observations.},

	Abstract = {We derive the electron temperature gradient in the Galactic disk, using a sample of H II regions that spans Galactocentric distances of 0-17 kpc. The electron temperature was calculated using high-precision radio recombination line and continuum observations for more than 100 H II regions. Nebular Galactocentric distances were calculated in a consistent manner, using the radial velocities measured by our radio recombination line survey. The large number of nebulae widely distributed over the Galactic disk, together with the uniformity of our data, provide a secure estimate of the present electron temperature gradient in the Milky Way. Because metals are the main coolants in the photoionized gas, the electron temperature along the Galactic disk should be directly related to the distribution of heavy elements in the Milky Way. Our best estimate of the electron temperature gradient is derived from a sample of 76 sources for which we have the highest quality data. The present gradient in electron temperature has a minimum at the Galactic center and rises at a rate of 287+/-46 K kpc-1. There are no significant variations in the value of the gradient as a function of Galactocentric radius or azimuth. The scatter we find in the H II region electron temperatures at a given Galactocentric radius is not due to observational error, but rather to intrinsic fluctuations in these temperatures, which are almost certainly due to fluctuations in the nebular heavy-element abundances. Comparing the H II region gradient with the much steeper gradient found for planetary nebulae suggests that the electron temperature gradient evolves with time, becoming flatter as a consequence of the chemical evolution of the Milky Way's disk.},

	Abstract = {We present a method to analyze the spectral energy distributions (SEDs) of young stellar objects (YSOs). Our approach is to fit data with precomputed two-dimensional (2D) radiation transfer models spanning a large region of parameter space. This allows us to determine not only a single set of physical parameter values but the entire range of values consistent with the multiwavelength observations of a given source. In this way we hope to avoid any overinterpretation when modeling a set of data. We have constructed spectral energy distributions from optical to submillimeter wavelengths, including new Spitzer IRAC and MIPS photometry, for 30 young and spatially resolved sources in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region. We demonstrate fitting model SEDs to these sources and find that we correctly identify the evolutionary stage and physical parameters found from previous independent studies, such as disk mass, disk accretion rate, and stellar temperature. We also explore how fluxes at various wavelengths help to constrain physical parameters and show examples of degeneracies that can occur when fitting SEDs. A Web-based version of this tool is available to the community.},

	Abstract = {Context: The infrared wide-field camera (WFCAM) is now in operation on the 3.8 m UK Infrared Telescope on Mauna Kea. WFCAM currently has the fastest survey speed of any infrared camera in the world, and combined with generous allocations of telescope time, will produce deep maps of the sky from Z to K band. The data from a set of public surveys, known as UKIDSS, will be initially available to astronomers in ESO member states, and later to the world.  Aims: In order to maximise survey speed, the WFCAM field of view was required to be as large as possible while incorporating conventional infrared-instrument design features such as a cold re-imaged pupil stop and cryogenic optics and mechanisms. Methods: The solution adopted was to build a cryogenic Schmidt-type camera, mounted forward of the primary mirror, which illuminates a very large 0.9$\,^{\circ}$ diameter focal plane, containing four 2k × 2k HgCdTe Rockwell detectors.   Results: Following several commissioning periods during which the camera, focal plane and telescope optical axes were successfully co-aligned, WFCAM now operates close to specifications, regularly achieving 0.7´´ FWHM images over the full field. Projects which already report excellent results include the detection of variability in young stellar clusters, as well as preliminary deep IR imaging of the Subaru and XMM-Newton deep field.},

	Abstract = {Aims:We investigate the star BD+43$\,^{\circ}$ 3654 and the possibility that it may have originated in the massive OB association Cygnus OB2.  Methods: We present new spectroscopic observations allowing a reliable spectral classification of the star, and discuss existing MSX observations of its associated bow shock and astrometric information not previously studied. Results: Our observations reveal that BD+43$\,^{\circ}$ 3654 is a very early and luminous star of spectral type O4If, with an estimated mass of (70 $\pm$ 15) M_&sun; and an age of ~1.6 Myr. The high spatial resolution of the MSX observations allows us to determine its direction of motion in the plane of the sky by means of the symmetry axis of the well-defined bow shock, which matches well the orientation expected from the proper motion. Tracing back its path across the sky we find that BD+43$\,^{\circ}$ 3654 was located near the central, densest region of Cygnus OB2 at a time in the past similar to its estimated age.  Conclusions: BD+43$\,^{\circ}$ 3654 turns out to be one of the three most massive runaway stars known, and it most likely formed in the central region of Cygnus OB2. A runaway formation mechanism by means of dynamical ejection is consistent with our results.

	Abstract = {We present observations of 1.2 mm dust continuum emission made with the Swedish-ESO Submillimeter Telescope toward 18 luminous IRAS point sources, all with colors typical of compact H II regions and associated with CS(2-->1) emission, thought to be representative of young massive star forming regions. Emission was detected toward all the IRAS objects. We find that the 1.2 mm sources associated with them have distinct physical parameters, namely sizes of ~0.4 pc, dust temperatures of ~30 K, masses of ~2×103 Msolar, column densities of ~3×1023 cm-2, and densities of ~4×105 cm-3. We refer to these dust structures as massive and dense cores. Most of the 1.2 mm sources show single-peaked structures, several of which exhibit a bright compact peak surrounded by a weaker extended envelope. The observed radial intensity profiles of sources with this type of morphology are well fitted with power-law intensity profiles with power-law indices in the range of 1.0-1.7. This result indicates that massive and dense cores are centrally condensed, having radial density profiles with power-law indices in the range of 1.5-2.2. We also find that the UC H II regions detected with ATCA toward the IRAS sources investigated here (Paper I) are usually projected at the peak position of the 1.2 mm dust continuum emission, suggesting that massive stars are formed at the center of the centrally condensed massive and dense cores.},

	Abstract = {We use Spitzer Space Telescope observations from the Spitzer Survey of the Small Magellanic Cloud (S3MC) to study the young stellar content of N66, the largest and brightest H II region in the SMC. In addition to large numbers of normal stars, we detect a significant population of bright, red infrared sources that we identify as likely to be young stellar objects (YSOs). We use spectral energy distribution (SED) fits to classify objects as ordinary (main-sequence or red giant) stars, asymptotic giant branch stars, background galaxies, and YSOs. This represents the first large-scale attempt at blind source classification based on Spitzer SEDs in another galaxy. We firmly identify at least 61 YSOs, with another 50 probable YSOs; only one embedded protostar in the SMC was reported in the literature prior to the S3MC. We present color selection criteria that can be used to identify a relatively clean sample of YSOs with IRAC photometry. Our fitted SEDs indicate that the infrared-bright YSOs in N66 have stellar masses ranging from 2 to 17 Msolar, and that approximately half of the objects are stage II protostars, with the remaining YSOs roughly evenly divided between stage I and stage III sources. We find evidence for primordial mass segregation in the H II region, with the most massive YSOs being preferentially closer to the center than lower mass objects. Despite the low metallicity and dust content of the SMC, the observable properties of the YSOs appear consistent with those in the Milky Way. Although the YSOs are heavily concentrated within the optically bright central region of N66, there is ongoing star formation throughout the complex, and we place a lower limit on the star formation rate of 3.2×10-3 Msolar yr-1 over the last ~1 Myr.},

@article{Motte:2007aa,
	Abstract = {Aims:Our current knowledge of high-mass star formation is mainly based on follow-up studies of bright sources found by IRAS, and is thus biased against its earliest phases, inconspicuous at infrared wavelengths. We therefore started searching, in an unbiased way and in the closest high-mass star-forming complexes, for the high-mass analogs of low-mass pre-stellar cores and class 0 protostars.  Methods: We have made an extensive 1.2 mm continuum mosaicing study of the Cygnus X molecular cloud complex using the MAMBO cameras at the IRAM 30 m telescope. The ˜ 3$\,^{\circ}$2 imaged areas cover all the high-column density (AV >= 15 mag) clouds of this nearby (~1.7 kpc) cloud complex actively forming OB stars. We then compared our millimeter maps with mid-infrared images, and have made SiO(2-1) follow-up observations of the best candidate progenitors of high-mass stars.  Results: Our complete study of Cygnus X with ~0.09 pc resolution provides, for the first time, an unbiased census of massive young stellar objects. We discover 129 massive dense cores (FWHM size ~0.1 pc, M1.2~mm = 4-950 M_&sun;, volume-averaged density ~105 cm-3), among which ~42 are probable precursors of high-mass stars. A large fraction of the Cygnus X dense cores (2/3 of the sample) remain undetected by the MSX satellite, regardless of the mass range considered. Among the most massive (>=40 M_&sun;) cores, infrared-quiet objects are driving powerful outflows traced by SiO emission. Our study qualifies 17 cores as good candidates for hosting massive infrared-quiet protostars, while up to 25 cores potentially host high-luminosity infrared protostars. We fail to discover the high-mass analogs of pre-stellar dense cores (~0.1 pc, > 104 cm-3) in Cygnus X, but find several massive starless clumps (~ 0.8 pc, 7 × 103 cm-3) that might be gravitationally bound.  Conclusions: Since our sample is derived from a single molecular complex and covers every embedded phase of high-mass star formation, it gives the first statistical estimates of their lifetime. In contrast to what is found for low-mass class 0 and class I phases, the infrared-quiet protostellar phase of high-mass stars may last as long as their better-known high-luminosity infrared phase. The statistical lifetimes of high-mass protostars and pre-stellar cores (~ 3 × 104 yr and < 103 yr) in Cygnus X are one and two order(s) of magnitude smaller, respectively, than what is found in nearby, low-mass star-forming regions. We therefore propose that high-mass pre-stellar and protostellar cores are in a highly dynamic state, as expected in a molecular cloud where turbulent processes dominate.},

@article{Krumholz:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Massive stars are very rare, but their extreme luminosities make them both the only type of young star we can observe in distant galaxies and the dominant energy sources in the Universe today. They form rarely because efficient radiative cooling keeps most star-forming gas clouds close to isothermal as they collapse, and this favours fragmentation into stars of one solar mass or lower. Heating of a cloud by accreting low-mass stars within it can prevent fragmentation and allow formation of massive stars, but the necessary properties for a cloud to form massive stars-and therefore where massive stars form in a galaxy-have not yet been determined. Here we show that only clouds with column densities of at least 1gcm-2 can avoid fragmentation and form massive stars. This threshold, and the environmental variation of the stellar initial mass function that it implies, naturally explain the characteristic column densities associated with massive star clusters and the difference between the radial profiles of Halpha and ultraviolet emission in galactic disks. The existence of a threshold also implies that the initial mass function should show detectable variation with environment within the Galaxy, that the characteristic column densities of clusters containing massive stars should vary between galaxies, and that star formation rates in some galactic environments may have been systematically underestimated.},

@article{Molinari:2008aa,
	Abstract = {Context: The mechanism of formation of massive stars is still a matter of debate. It is not yet clear if it can be considered to be a scaled-up analogue of the low-mass star regime, or if there are additional agents like merging of lower-mass forming objects or accretion from initially unbound material. Most of the uncertainties come from the lack of diagnostic tools to evolutionarily classify large samples of candidate massive protostellar objects that can then be studied in more detail. Aims: We want to verify whether diagnostic tools like the SED shape and the relationship between envelope mass and bolometric luminosity can be extended to the study of high-mass star formation. Methods: The 8-1200 mum SED of YSOs in 42 regions of massive star formation has been reconstructed using MSX, IRAS, and submm data partly available from previous works. Apart from IRAS catalogue fluxes, the fluxes in the Mid-IR and sub-mm/mm were derived directly from the images. The SEDs were fitted to an extensive grid of envelope models with embedded ZAMS stars, available from the literature. Sources that could not be fitted with a single model were then fitted with a two-component model composed of an embedded ZAMS for the mid-IR part and a single-temperature optically thin greybody for the longer wavelength emitting component. Sources were classified as ``IR'' if they were fitted with an embedded ZAMS envelope, and ``MM'' if they could only be fitted with a greybody with a peak at high lambda; further subclassification was based on being the most massive object in the field (``P'', for primary) or not (``S'', for secondary).  Results: The different classes of sources identified in our analysis have very different SEDs and occupy distinct areas in the L_bol-M_env diagram; by analogy with the low-mass regime, we see that MM-P, IR-P and IR-S objects could be interpreted as the high-mass analogue of Class 0-I-II. Evolutionary tracks obtained from a simple model based on the turbulent core prescriptions show that the three classes of sources possibly mark different periods in the formation of a massive YSO. The IR-P objects are consistent with being at the end of the main accretion phase, while MM-P sources are probably in an earlier evolutionary stage. The timescales for the formation decrease from ~ 4×105 to ~ 1×105 years with stellar mass increasing from ~6 to ~40 M&sun;; these timescales, and the association with young clusters with median stellar age of a few 106 years suggest that the most massive objects are among the last ones to form.  Conclusions: Our results are consistent with the high-mass star formation being a scaled-up analogue of the traditional accretion-dominated paradigm valid for the low-mass regime.

	Abstract = {Aims: Archeops is a balloon-borne experiment, mainly designed to measure the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB) temperature anisotropies at high angular resolution (~12 arcmin). By-products of the mission are shallow sensitivity maps over a large fraction of the sky (about 30%) in the millimetre and submillimetre range at 143, 217, 353 and 545 GHz. From these maps, we produce a catalog of bright submillimetre point sources. Methods: We present in this paper the processing and analysis of the Archeops point sources. Redundancy across detectors is the key factor allowing us to distinguish glitches from genuine point sources in the 20 independent maps.  Results: We look at the properties of the most reliable point sources, totalling 304. Fluxes range from 1 to 10 000 Jy (at the frequencies covering 143 to 545 GHz). All sources are either planets (2) or of galactic origin. The longitude range is from 75 to 198 degrees. Some of the sources are associated with the well-known Lynds Nebulae and HII compact regions in the galactic plane. A large fraction of the sources have an IRAS counterpart. Except for Jupiter, Saturn, the Crab and Cas A, all sources show a dust-emission-like modified blackbody emission spectrum. Temperatures cover a range from 7 to 27 K. For the coldest sources (T < 10 K), a steep nu beta emissivity law is found with a surprising beta ~ 3 to 4. An inverse relationship between T and beta is observed. The number density of sources at 353 GHz with flux brighter than 100 Jy is of the order of 1 per degree of Galactic longitude. These sources will provide a strong check for the calibration of the Planck HFI focal plane geometry as a complement to planets. These very cold sources observed by Archeops should be prime targets for mapping observations by the Akari and Herschel space missions and ground-based observatories.

	Abstract = {We demonstrate the utility of dendrograms at representing the essential features of the hierarchical structure of the isosurfaces for molecular line data cubes. The dendrogram of a data cube is an abstraction of the changing topology of the isosurfaces as a function of contour level. The ability to track hierarchical structure over a range of scales makes this analysis philosophically different from local segmentation algorithms like CLUMPFIND. Points in the dendrogram structure correspond to specific volumes in data cubes defined by their bounding isosurfaces. We further refine the technique by measuring the properties associated with each isosurface in the analysis allowing for a multiscale calculation of molecular gas properties. Using COMPLETE13CO (J = 1--> 0) data from the L1448 region in Perseus and mock observations of a simulated data cube, we identify regions that have a significant contribution by self-gravity to their energetics on a range of scales. We find evidence for self-gravitation on all spatial scales in L1448, although not in all regions. In the simulated observations, nearly all of the emission is found in objects that would be self-gravitating if gravity were included in the simulation. We reconstruct the size-line-width relationship within the data cube using the dendrogram-derived properties and find it follows the standard relation: sigmav propto R0.58. Finally, we show that constructing the dendrogram of CO (J = 1--> 0) emission from the Orion-Monoceros region allows for the identification of giant molecular clouds in a blended molecular line data set using only a physically motivated definition (self-gravitating clouds with masses >5 × 104 M&sun;).},

	Abstract = {Aims: To study the structure of nearby (<500 pc) dense starless and star-forming cores with the particular goal to identify and understand evolutionary trends in core properties, and to explore the nature of Very Low Luminosity Objects (<=0.1 L&sun;; VeLLOs). Methods: Using the MAMBO bolometer array, we create maps unusually sensitive to faint (few mJy per beam) extended (≈5 arcmin) thermal dust continuum emission at 1.2 mm wavelength. Complementary information on embedded stars is obtained from Spitzer, IRAS, and 2MASS.   Results: Our maps are very rich in structure, and we characterize extended emission features (``subcores'') and compact intensity peaks in our data separately to pay attention to this complexity. We derive, e.g., sizes, masses, and aspect ratios for the subcores, as well as column densities and related properties for the peaks. Combination with archival infrared data then enables the derivation of bolometric luminosities and temperatures, as well as envelope masses, for the young embedded stars.   Conclusions: Starless and star-forming cores occupy the same parameter space in many core properties; a picture of dense core evolution in which any dense core begins to actively form stars once it exceeds some fixed limit in, e.g., mass, density, or both, is inconsistent with our data. A concept of necessary conditions for star formation appears to provide a better description: dense cores fulfilling certain conditions can form stars, but they do not need to, respectively have not done so yet. Comparison of various evolutionary indicators for young stellar objects in our sample (e.g., bolometric temperatures) reveals inconsistencies between some of them, possibly suggesting a revision of some of these indicators. Finally, we challenge the notion that VeLLOs form in cores not expected to actively form stars, and we present a first systematic study revealing evidence for structural differences between starless and candidate VeLLO cores.

	Abstract = {The young stellar population data of the Perseus, Ophiuchus and Serpens molecular clouds are obtained from the Spitzer Cores to Discs (c2d) legacy survey in order to investigate the spatial structure of embedded clusters using the nearest-neighbour (NN) and minimum-spanning tree method. We identify the embedded clusters in these clouds as density enhancements and analyse the clustering parameter with respect to source luminosity and evolutionary stage. This analysis shows that the older Class 2/3 objects are more centrally condensed than the younger Class 0/1 protostars, indicating that clusters evolve from an initial hierarchical configuration to a centrally condensed one. Only IC 348 and the Serpens core, the older clusters in the sample, show signs of mass segregation (indicated by the dependence of on the source magnitude), pointing to a significant effect of dynamical interactions after a few Myr. The structure of a cluster may also be linked to the turbulent energy in the natal cloud as the most centrally condensed cluster is found in the cloud with the lowest Mach number and vice versa. In general, these results agree well with theoretical scenarios of star cluster formation by gravoturbulent fragmentation.},

	Abstract = {Using images from the Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire (GLIMPSE), we have identified more than 300 extended 4.5 mum sources (Extended Green Objects (EGOs), for the common coding of the [4.5] band as green in three-color composite InfraRed Array Camera images). We present a catalog of these EGOs, including integrated flux density measurements at 3.6, 4.5, 5.8, 8.0, and 24 mum from GLIMPSE and the Multiband Imaging Photometer for Spitzer Galactic Plane Survey. The average angular separation between a source in our sample and the nearest IRAS point source is greater than 1'. The majority of EGOs are associated with infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), and where high-resolution 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser surveys overlap the GLIMPSE coverage, EGOs and 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers are strongly correlated. Extended 4.5 mum emission is thought to trace shocked molecular gas in protostellar outflows; the association of EGOs with IRDCs and 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers suggests that the extended 4.5 mum emission may pinpoint outflows specifically from massive protostars. The mid-IR colors of EGOs lie in regions of color-color space occupied by young protostars still embedded in infalling envelopes.},

	Abstract = {A brief description is given of the GLIMPSE surveys, including the areas surveyed, sensitivity limits, and products. The primary motivations for this review are to describe some of the main scientific results enabled by the GLIMPSE surveys and to note potential future applications of the GLIMPSE catalogs and images. In particular, we discuss contributions to our understanding of star formation and early evolution, the interstellar medium, galactic structure, and evolved stars. Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs), young stellar objects (YSOs), and infrared bubbles/H II regions are discussed in some detail. A probable triggered star formation associated with expanding infrared bubbles is briefly mentioned. The distribution and morphologies of dust and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in the interstellar medium are discussed. Examples are shown from GLIMPSE images of bow shocks, pillars (elephant trunks), and instabilities in massive star-formation regions. The infrared extinction law of diffuse interstellar dust is discussed. The large-scale structure of the Galaxy has been traced by red-clump giants using the GLIMPSE point-source catalog to reveal the radius and orientation of the central bar, the stellar radial scale length, an obvious increase in star counts toward the tangency to the Scutum-Centaurus spiral arm, the lack of an obvious tangency from star counts toward the Sagittarius spiral arm, and a sharp increase in star counts toward the nuclear bulge. Recent results on evolved stars and some serendipitous discoveries are mentioned. More than 70 refereed papers have been published based on GLIMPSE data as of 2008 November.},

@article{Chambers:2009aa,
	Abstract = {Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) contain compact cores which probably host the early stages of high-mass star formation. Many of these cores contain regions of extended, enhanced 4.5 mum emission, the so-called "green fuzzies," which indicate shocked gas. Many cores also contain 24 mum emission, presumably from heated dust which indicates embedded protostars. Because "green fuzzies" and 24 mum point sources both indicate star formation, we have developed an algorithm to identify star-forming cores within IRDCs by searching for the simultaneous presence of these two distinct indicators. We employ this algorithm on a sample of 190 cores found toward IRDCs, and classify the cores as "active" if they contain a green fuzzy coincident with an embedded 24 mum source, and as "quiescent" if they contain neither IR signature. We hypothesize that the "quiescent" cores represent the earliest "preprotostellar" (starless) core phase, before the development of a warm protostar, and that the "active" cores represent a later phase, after the development of a protostar. We test this idea by comparing the sizes, densities, and maser activity of the "active" and "quiescent" cores. We find that, on average, "active" cores have smaller sizes, higher densities, and more pronounced water and methanol maser activity than the "quiescent" cores. This is expected if the "quiescent" cores are in an earlier evolutionary state than the "active" cores. The masses of "active" cores suggest that they may be forming high-mass stars. The highest mass "quiescent" cores are excellent candidates for the elusive high-mass starless cores.},

	Abstract = {In this paper, we describe the photometric calibration of data taken with the near-infrared Wide Field Camera (WFCAM) on the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope (UKIRT). The broad-band ZYJHK data are directly calibrated from Two-Micron All-Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources which are abundant in every WFCAM pointing. We perform an analysis of spatial systematics in the photometric calibration, both inter- and intradetector show that these are present at up to the ~5per cent level in WFCAM. Although the causes of these systematics are not yet fully understood, a method for their removal is developed and tested. Following the application of the correction procedure, the photometric calibration of WFCAM is found to be accurate to ~=1.5per cent for the JHK bands and 2per cent for the ZY bands, meeting the survey requirements. We investigate the transformations between the 2MASS and WFCAM systems and find that the Z and Y calibrations are sensitive to the effects of interstellar reddening for large values of E(B - V)', but that the JHK filters remain largely unaffected. We measure a small correction to the WFCAM Y-band photometry required to place WFCAM on a Vega system, and investigate WFCAM measurements of published standard stars from the list of UKIRT faint standards. Finally, we present empirically determined throughput measurements for WFCAM.},

	Abstract = {We investigate how uncertainties in flux measurements affect the results from modified blackbody spectral energy distribution (SED) fits. We show that an inverse correlation between the dust temperature T and spectral index beta naturally arises from least-squares fits due to the uncertainties, even for sources with a single T and beta. Fitting SEDs to noisy fluxes solely in the Rayleigh-Jeans regime produces unreliable T and beta estimates. Thus, for long wavelength observations (lambda gsim 200 mum), or for warm sources (T gsim 60 K), it becomes difficult to distinguish sources with different temperatures. We assess the role of noise in recent observational results that indicate an inverse and continuously varying T-beta relation. Though an inverse and continuous T-beta correlation may be a physical property of dust in the interstellar medium, we find that the observed inverse correlation may be primarily due to noise.},

	Abstract = {We present the results of a high angular resolution Very Large Array (VLA) Class I 44 GHz and Class II 6.7 GHz CH3OH maser survey of a sample of ~20 massive young stellar object (MYSO) outflow candidates selected on the basis of extended 4.5 mum emission in Spitzer Galactic Legacy Infrared Mid-Plane Survey Extraordinaire images. These 4.5 mum selected candidates are referred to as extended green objects (EGOs), for the common coding of this band as green in three-color Infrared Array Camera images. The detection rate of 6.7 GHz Class II CH3OH masers, which are associated exclusively with massive YSOs, toward EGOs is gsim64%---nearly double the detection rate of surveys using other MYSO selection criteria. The detection rate of Class I 44 GHz CH3OH masers, which trace molecular outflows, is ~89% toward EGOs associated with 6.7 GHz CH3OH masers. The two types of CH3OH masers exhibit different spatial distributions: 6.7 GHz masers are centrally concentrated and usually coincide with 24 mum emission, while 44 GHz masers are widely distributed and generally trace diffuse 4.5 mum features. We also present results of a complementary James Clerk Maxwell Telescope (JCMT) single-pointing molecular line survey of EGOs in the outflow tracers HCO+(3-2) and SiO(5-4). The HCO+ line profiles and high SiO detection rate (90%) are indicative of the presence of active outflows. No 44 GHz continuum emission is detected at the 5 mJy beam-1 (5sigma) level toward 95% of EGOs surveyed, excluding bright ultracompact H II regions as powering sources for the 4.5 mum outflows. The results of our surveys constitute strong evidence that EGOs are young, massive YSOs, with active outflows, presumably powered by ongoing accretion.},

	Abstract = {Hi-GAL, the Herschel infrared Galactic Plane Survey, is an Open Time Key Project of the Herschel Space Observatory. It will make an unbiased photometric survey of the inner Galactic plane by mapping a 2$\,^{\circ}$ wide strip in the longitude range |l| < 60$\,^{\circ}$ in five wavebands between 70 mum and 500 mum. The aim of Hi-GAL is to detect the earliest phases of the formation of molecular clouds and high-mass stars and to use the optimum combination of Herschel wavelength coverage, sensitivity, mapping strategy, and speed to deliver a homogeneous census of star-forming regions and cold structures in the interstellar medium. The resulting representative samples will yield the variation of source temperature, luminosity, mass and age in a wide range of Galactic environments at all scales from massive YSOs in protoclusters to entire spiral arms, providing an evolutionary sequence for the formation of intermediate and high-mass stars. This information is essential to the formulation of a predictive global model of the role of environment and feedback in regulating the star-formation process. Such a model is vital to understanding star formation on galactic scales and in the early universe. Hi-GAL will also provide a science legacy for decades to come with incalculable potential for systematic and serendipitous science in a wide range of astronomical fields, enabling the optimum use of future major facilities such as JWST and ALMA.},

@article{Rathborne:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Identified as extinction features against the bright Galactic mid-infrared background, infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) are thought to harbor the very earliest stages of star and cluster formation. In order to better characterize the properties of their embedded cores, we have obtained new 24 mum, 60-100 mum, and submillimeter continuum data toward a sample of 38 IRDCs. The 24 mum Spitzer images reveal that while the IRDCs remain dark, many of the cores are associated with bright 24 mum emission sources, which suggests that they contain one or more embedded protostars. Combining the 24 mum, 60-100 mum, and submillimeter continuum data, we have constructed broadband spectral energy distributions (SEDs) for 157 of the cores within these IRDCs and, using simple graybody fits to the SEDs, have estimated their dust temperatures, emissivities, opacities, bolometric luminosities, masses, and densities. Based on their Spitzer/Infrared Array Camera 3-8 mum colors and the presence of 24 mum point-source emission, we have separated cores that harbor active, high-mass star formation from cores that are quiescent. The active "protostellar" cores typically have warmer dust temperatures and higher bolometric luminosities than the more quiescent, perhaps "pre-protostellar," cores. Because the mass distributions of the populations are similar, however, we speculate that the active and quiescent cores may represent different evolutionary stages of the same underlying population of cores. Although we cannot rule out low-mass star formation in the quiescent cores, the most massive of them are excellent candidates for the "high-mass starless core" phase, the very earliest in the formation of a high-mass star.},

	Abstract = {We have carried out a near-infrared imaging survey of luminous young stellar outflow candidates using the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope. Observations were obtained through the broad-band K (2.2mum) and narrow-band filters at the wavelengths of H2v = 1-0 S(1) (2.1218mum) and Brgamma (2.166mum) lines. 50 regions were imaged with a field of view of 2.2 × 2.2arcmin2. Several young embedded clusters are unveiled in our near-infrared images. 76 per cent of the objects exhibit H2 emission and 50 per cent or more of the objects exhibit aligned H2 emission features suggesting collimated outflows, many of which are new detections. These observations suggest that disc accretion is probably the leading mechanism in the formation of stars, at least up to late O spectral types. The young stellar objects (YSOs) responsible for many of these outflows are positively identified in our images based on their locations with respect to the outflow lobes, Two-Micron All-Sky Survey colours and association with Midcourse Space Experiment, Infrared Astronomical Satellite, millimetre and radio sources. The close association of molecular outflows detected in CO with the H2 emission features produced by shock excitation by jets from the YSOs suggests that the outflows from these objects are jet-driven. Towards strong radio emitting sources, H2 jets were either not detected or were weak when detected, implying that most of the accretion happens in the pre-ultracompact (pre-UC) HII phase; accretion and outflows are probably weak when the YSO has advanced to its UC HII stage.},

@article{Lopez-Sepulcre:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: We have searched for star formation activity (mainly infall and outflow signatures) in a sample of high-mass molecular clumps (M > 100 M&sun;) in different evolutionary stages and with a wide range of surface densities, with the aim of looking for evolutionary trends and testing observationally recent theoretical models which predict the need for a minimum surface density to form high-mass stars.  Methods: Our sample has been selected from single-dish 1.2 mm continuum surveys and is composed of 48 massive molecular clumps, of which 29 are IR-loud and 19 are IR-dark. Each of these has been mapped in the HCO+(1-0), HCN(1-0) and C18O(2-1) transitions with the IRAM-30 m telescope on Pico Veleta (Spain). We derive basic parameters (mass, momentum, kinetic energy) for the clumps and their associated outflows and examine the HCO+(1-0) line profiles for evidence of infall or expansion.  Results: Molecular outflows have been detected in 75% of our targets from the presence of high-velocity wings in the HCO+(1-0) spectra. These are equally frequent and massive (between ~1 and ~100 M&sun;) in IR-dark and IR-loud clumps, implying similar levels of star formation activity in both kinds of objects. A surface density threshold at Sigma = 0.3 g cm-2 has been found above which the outflow detection rate increases significantly and the outflows are on average more massive. The infall detection rate in our sample is low, but significantly higher in the IR-dark sub-sample. Our clump mass estimates using the mm dust emission and C18O(2-1) are sensitive to the temperature, but assuming a value of 15 K for the IR-dark sub-sample, we find evidence that C18O is depleted by a factor ~4.5. The HCO+(1-0) to HCN(1-0) integrated intensity ratios measured reveal a greater dispersion about the mean value in the IR-dark sub-sample than in the IR-loud by a factor of about 5. We find that a considerable number of IR-dark sources are self-absorbed in HCN(1-0) suggesting that radiative transport effects in the ground state transitions have an important influence on the integrated intensity ratio.  Conclusions: Our results indicate that, in terms of outflow frequency and energetics, both IR-dark and IR-loud molecular clumps present equivalent signatures of star formation activity, and that the formation of high-mass stars requires sufficiently high clump surface densities. The higher infall detection rate measured for the IR-dark subsample suggests that these objects could be associated with the onset of star formation.

	Abstract = {Herschel was launched on 14 May 2009, and is now an operational ESA space observatory offering unprecedented observational capabilities in the far-infrared and submillimetre spectral range 55-671 mum. Herschel carries a 3.5 m diameter passively cooled Cassegrain telescope, which is the largest of its kind and utilises a novel silicon carbide technology. The science payload comprises three instruments: two direct detection cameras/medium resolution spectrometers, PACS and SPIRE, and a very high-resolution heterodyne spectrometer, HIFI, whose focal plane units are housed inside a superfluid helium cryostat. Herschel is an observatory facility operated in partnership among ESA, the instrument consortia, and NASA. The mission lifetime is determined by the cryostat hold time. Nominally approximately 20 000 h will be available for astronomy, 32% is guaranteed time and the remainder is open to the worldwide general astronomical community through a standard competitive proposal procedure.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {The Photodetector Array Camera and Spectrometer (PACS) is one of the three science instruments on ESA's far infrared and submillimetre observatory. It employs two Ge:Ga photoconductor arrays (stressed and unstressed) with 16×25 pixels, each, and two filled silicon bolometer arrays with 16×32 and 32×64 pixels, respectively, to perform integral-field spectroscopy and imaging photometry in the 60-210 mum wavelength regime. In photometry mode, it simultaneously images two bands, 60-85 mum or 85-125 mum and 125-210 mum, over a field of view of ~1.75'× 3.5', with close to Nyquist beam sampling in each band. In spectroscopy mode, it images a field of 47'' × 47'', resolved into 5×5 pixels, with an instantaneous spectral coverage of ~1500 km s-1 and a spectral resolution of ~175 km s-1. We summarise the design of the instrument, describe observing modes, calibration, and data analysis methods, and present our current assessment of the in-orbit performance of the instrument based on the performance verification tests. PACS is fully operational, and the achieved performance is close to or better than the pre-launch predictions.

@article{Griffin:2010aa,
	Abstract = {The Spectral and Photometric Imaging REceiver (SPIRE), is the Herschel Space Observatory`s submillimetre camera and spectrometer. It contains a three-band imaging photometer operating at 250, 350 and 500 mum, and an imaging Fourier-transform spectrometer (FTS) which covers simultaneously its whole operating range of 194-671 mum (447-1550 GHz). The SPIRE detectors are arrays of feedhorn-coupled bolometers cooled to 0.3 K. The photometer has a field of view of 4´× 8´, observed simultaneously in the three spectral bands. Its main operating mode is scan-mapping, whereby the field of view is scanned across the sky to achieve full spatial sampling and to cover large areas if desired. The spectrometer has an approximately circular field of view with a diameter of 2.6´. The spectral resolution can be adjusted between 1.2 and 25 GHz by changing the stroke length of the FTS scan mirror. Its main operating mode involves a fixed telescope pointing with multiple scans of the FTS mirror to acquire spectral data. For extended source measurements, multiple position offsets are implemented by means of an internal beam steering mirror to achieve the desired spatial sampling and by rastering of the telescope pointing to map areas larger than the field of view. The SPIRE instrument consists of a cold focal plane unit located inside the Herschel cryostat and warm electronics units, located on the spacecraft Service Module, for instrument control and data handling. Science data are transmitted to Earth with no on-board data compression, and processed by automatic pipelines to produce calibrated science products. The in-flight performance of the instrument matches or exceeds predictions based on pre-launch testing and modelling: the photometer sensitivity is comparable to or slightly better than estimated pre-launch, and the spectrometer sensitivity is also better by a factor of 1.5-2.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.},

	Abstract = {The Polaris Flare cloud region contains a great deal of extended emission. It is at high declination and high Galactic latitude. It was previously seen strongly in IRAS Cirrus emission at 100 microns. We have detected it with both PACS and SPIRE on Herschel. We see filamentary and low-level structure. We identify the five densest cores within this structure. We present the results of a temperature, mass and density analysis of these cores. We compare their observed masses to their virial masses, and see that in all cases the observed masses lie close to the lower end of the range of estimated virial masses. Therefore, we cannot say whether they are gravitationally bound prestellar cores. Nevertheless, these are the best candidates to be potential prestellar cores in the Polaris cloud region.

@article{Anderson:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Context. RCW 120 is a well-studied, nearby Galactic H ii region with ongoing star formation in its surroundings. Previous work has shown that it displays a bubble morphology at mid-infrared wavelengths, and has a massive layer of collected neutral material seen at sub-mm wavelengths. Given the well-defined photo-dissociation region (PDR) boundary and collected layer, it is an excellent laboratory to study the ``collect and collapse'' process of triggered star formation. Using Herschel Space Observatory data at 100, 160, 250, 350, and 500 mum, in combination with Spitzer and APEX-LABOCA data, we can for the first time map the entire spectral energy distribution of an H ii region at high angular resolution.  Aims: We seek a better understanding of RCW 120 and its local environment by analysing its dust temperature distribution. Additionally, we wish to understand how the dust emissivity index, beta, is related to the dust temperature.  Methods: We determine dust temperatures in selected regions of the RCW 120 field by fitting their spectral energy distribution (SED), derived using aperture photometry. Additionally, we fit the SED extracted from a grid of positions to create a temperature map.  Results: We find a gradient in dust temperature, ranging from ⪆30 K in the interior of RCW 120, to ~20 K for the material collected in the PDR, to ~10 K toward local infrared dark clouds and cold filaments. There is an additional, hotter (~100 K) component to the dust emission that we do not investigate here. Our results suggest that RCW 120 is in the process of destroying the PDR delineating its bubble morphology. The leaked radiation from its interior may influence the creation of the next generation of stars. We find support for an anti-correlation between the fitted temperature and beta, in rough agreement with what has been found previously. The extended wavelength coverage of the Herschel data greatly increases the reliability of this result.

	Abstract = {We present the 1.1 mm Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) observations of the Gemini OB1 molecular cloud complex, and targeted NH3 observations of the BGPS sources. When paired with molecular spectroscopy of a dense gas tracer, millimeter observations yield physical properties such as masses, radii, mean densities, kinetic temperatures, and line widths. We detect 34 distinct BGPS sources above 5sigma = 0.37 Jy beam-1 with corresponding 5sigma detections in the NH3(1,1) transition. Eight of the objects show water maser emission (20%). We find a mean millimeter source FWHM of 1.12 pc and a mean gas kinetic temperature of 20 K for the sample of 34 BGPS sources with detections in the NH3(1,1) line. The observed NH3 line widths are dominated by non-thermal motions, typically found to be a few times the thermal sound speed expected for the derived kinetic temperature. We calculate the mass for each source from the millimeter flux assuming the sources are isothermal and find a mean isothermal mass within a 120'' aperture of 230 $\pm$ 180 M sun. We find a total mass of 8400 M sun for all BGPS sources in the Gemini OB1 molecular cloud, representing 6.5% of the cloud mass. By comparing the millimeter isothermal mass to the virial mass calculated from the NH3 line widths within a radius equal to the millimeter source size, we find a mean virial parameter (M vir/M iso) of 1.0 $\pm$ 0.9 for the sample. We find mean values for the distributions of column densities of 1.0 × 1022 cm-2 for H2, and 3.0 × 1014 cm-2 for NH3, giving a mean NH3 abundance of 3.0 × 10-8 relative to H2. We find volume-averaged densities on the order of 103-104 cm-3. The sizes and densities suggest that in the Gem OB1 region the BGPS is detecting the clumps from which stellar clusters form, rather than smaller, higher density cores where single stars or small multiple systems form.},

@article{Miettinen:2010aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) likely represent very early stages of high-mass star/star cluster formation.  Aims: The aim is to determine the physical properties and spatial distribution of dense clumps in the IRDC MSXDC G304.74+01.32 (G304.74), and bring these characteristics into relation to theories concerning the origin of IRDCs and their fragmentation into clumps and star-forming cores.  Methods: G304.74 was mapped in the 870 mum dust continuum with the LABOCA bolometer on APEX. The 870 mum map was compared with the 1.2 mm continuum map of the cloud by B{\'e}ltran et al. (2006, A&A, 447, 221). Archival MSX and IRAS infrared data were used to study the nature and properties of the submillimetre clumps within the cloud. The H2 column densities were estimated using both the 870 mum dust emission and the MSX 8 mum extinction data. The obtained values were compared with near-infrared extinction which could be estimated along a few lines of sight. We compared the clump masses and their spatial distribution in G304.74 with those in several other recently studied IRDCs.  Results: Twelve clumps were identified from the 870 mum dust continuum map. Three of them are associated with the MSX and IRAS point sources. Moreover, one of the clumps (SMM 6) is associated with two MSX 8 mum point-like sources. Thus, there are 8 clumps within G304.74 which are not associated with mid-infrared (MIR) emission. The H2 column densities derived from the dust continuum and extinction data are similar. The comparison suggests that the dust temperature may be elevated (20-30 K) near the southern end of the cloud, whereas the starless clumps in the centre and in the north are cool (Td ~ 15 K). There is a high likelihood that the clump mass distributions in G304.74 and in several other IRDCs represent the samples of the same parent distribution. In most cases the spatial distributions of clumps in IRDCs do not deviate significantly from random distributions.  Conclusions: G304.74 contains several massive clumps that are not associated with MIR emission. On statistical grounds it is likely that some of them are or harbour high-mass starless cores (HMSCs). The fact that the clump mass distributions (resembling the high-mass stellar IMF), and in some cases also the random-like spatial distributions, seem to be comparable between different IRDCs, is consistent with the idea that the origin of IRDCs, and their further sub-fragmentation down to scales of clumps is caused by supersonic turbulence in accordance with results from giant molecular clouds.  This publication is based on data acquired with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). APEX is a collaboration between the Max-Planck-Institut f{\"u}r Radioastronomie, the European Southern Observatory, and the Onsala Space Observatory.},

	Abstract = {Context. Variations in the dust emissivity are critical for gas mass determinations derived from far-infrared observations, but also for separating dust foreground emission from the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). Hi-GAL observations allow us for the first time to study the dust emissivity variations in the inner regions of the Galactic plane at resolution below 1$\,^{\circ}$.  Aims: We present maps of the emissivity spectral index derived from the combined Herschel PACS 160 mum, SPIRE 250 mum, 350 mum, and 500 mum data, and the IRIS 100 mum data, and we analyze the spatial variations of the spectral index as a function of dust temperature and wavelength in the two science demonstration phase Hi-GAL fields, centered at l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$.  Methods: Applying two different methods, we determine both dust temperature and emissivity spectral index between 100 and 500 mum, at an angular resolution (theta) of 4'.  Results: Combining both fields, the results show variations of the emissivity spectral index in the range 1.8-2.6 for temperatures between 14 and 23 K. The median values of the spectral index are similar in both fields, i.e. 2.3 in the range 100-500 mum, while the median dust temperatures are equal to 19.1 K and 16.0 K in the l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ field, respectively. Statistically, we do not see any significant deviations in the spectra from a power law emissivity between 100 and 500 mum. We confirm the existence of an inverse correlation between the emissivity spectral index and dust temperature, found in previous analyses.

	Abstract = {We examine the physical properties and evolutionary stages of a sample of 17 clumps within 8 Infrared Dark Clouds (IRDCs) by combining existing infrared, millimeter, and radio data with new Bolocam Galactic Plane Survey (BGPS) 1.1 mm data, Very Large Array radio continuum data, and Heinrich Hertz Telescope dense gas (HCO+ and N2H+) spectroscopic data. We combine literature studies of star formation tracers and dust temperatures within IRDCs with our search for ultracompact (UC) H II regions to discuss a possible evolutionary sequence for IRDC clumps. In addition, we perform an analysis of mass tracers in IRDCs and find that 8 mum extinction masses and 1.1 mm BGPS masses are complementary mass tracers in IRDCs except for the most active clumps (notably those containing UC H II regions), for which both mass tracers suffer biases. We find that the measured virial masses in IRDC clumps are uniformly higher than the measured dust continuum masses on the scale of ~1 pc. We use 13CO, HCO+, and N2H+ to study the molecular gas properties of IRDCs and do not see any evidence of chemical differentiation between hot and cold clumps on the scale of ~1 pc. However, both HCO+ and N2H+ are brighter in active clumps, due to an increase in temperature and/or density. We report the identification of four UC H II regions embedded within IRDC clumps and find that UC H II regions are associated with bright (gsim1 Jy) 24 mum point sources, and that the brightest UC H II regions are associated with "diffuse red clumps" (an extended enhancement at 8 mum). The broad stages of the discussed evolutionary sequence (from a quiescent clump to an embedded H II region) are supported by literature dust temperature estimates; however, no sequential nature can be inferred between the individual star formation tracers.},

	Abstract = {The first Herschel Hi-Gal images of the Galactic plane unveil the far-infrared diffuse emission of the interstellar medium with an unprecedented angular resolution and sensitivity. In this Letter, we present the first analysis of these data in combination with those of Spitzer GLIMPSE and MIPSGAL. We selected a relatively diffuse and low excitation region of the l ~ 59$\,^{\circ}$ Hi-Gal Science Demonstration Phase field to perform a pixel-by-pixel fitting of the 8 to 500 mum spectral energy distribution (SED) using the DustEM dust emission model. We derived maps of the very small grain (VSG) and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon (PAH) abundances from the model. Our analysis allows us to illustrate that the aromatic infrared band intensity does not necessarily trace the PAH abundance but rather the product of "abundance × column density × intensity of the exciting radiation field." We show that the spatial structure of PACS 70 mum maps resemble the shorter wavelengths (e.g., IRAC 8 mum) maps, because they trace both the intensity of exciting radiation field and column density. We also show that the modeled VSG contribution to PACS 70 mum (PACS 160 mum) band intensity can be up to 50% (7%). The interpretation of diffuse emission spectra at these wavelengths must take stochastically heated particles into account. Finally, this preliminary study emphasizes the potential of analyzing the full dust SED sampled by Herschel and Spitzer data, with a physical dust model (DustEM) to reach the properties of the dust at simultaneously large and small scales.  Herschel is an ESA space observatory with science instruments provided by European-led Principal Investigator consortia and with important participation from NASA.

The Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) is mapping the whole sky following its launch on 2009 December 14. WISE began surveying the sky on 2010 January 14 and completed its first full coverage of the sky on July 17. The survey will continue to cover the sky a second time until the cryogen is exhausted (anticipated in 2010 November). WISE is achieving 5sigma point source sensitivities better than 0.08, 0.11, 1, and 6 mJy in unconfused regions on the ecliptic in bands centered at wavelengths of 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum. Sensitivity improves toward the ecliptic poles due to denser coverage and lower zodiacal background. The angular resolution is 6farcs1, 6farcs4, 6farcs5, and 12farcs0 at 3.4, 4.6, 12, and 22 mum, and the astrometric precision for high signal-to-noise sources is better than 0farcs15.},

	Abstract = {The Herschel Space Observatory  is the fourth cornerstone mission in the ESA science programme and performs photometry and spectroscopy in the 55 - 672 micron range. The development of the Herschel Data Processing System started in 2002 to support the data analysis  for Instrument Level Tests. The Herschel Data Processing  System was used for the pre-flight characterisation of the instruments, and during various ground segment test campaigns. Following the successful launch of Herschel 14th of May 2009 the Herschel Data Processing System demonstrated its maturity when the first PACS preview observation of M51 was processed within 30 minutes of reception of the first science data after launch. Also the first HIFI observations on DR21 were successfully reduced to high quality spectra, followed by SPIRE observations on M66 and M74. A fast turn-around cycle between data retrieval and the production of science-ready products was demonstrated during the Herschel Science Demonstration Phase Initial Results Workshop held 7 months after launch, which is a clear proof that the system has reached a good level of maturity. We will summarise the scope, the management and development methodology of the Herschel Data Processing system, present some key software elements and give an overview about the current status and future development milestones.},

We describe the construction of convolution kernels that allow one to generate (multiwavelength) images with a common PSF, thus preserving the colors of the astronomical sources. We generate convolution kernels for the cameras of Spitzer, Herschel Space Observatory, Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX), Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), ground-based optical telescopes (Moffat functions and sum of Gaussians), and Gaussian PSFs. Kernels for other telescopes including IRAS, AKARI, and Planck, are currently being constructed. These kernels allow the study of the spectral energy distribution (SED) of extended objects, preserving the characteristic SED in each pixel. The convolution kernels and the IDL packages used to construct and use them are made publicly available.},

	Abstract = {Dynamical few-body encounters in the dense cores of young massive star clusters are responsible for the loss of a significant fraction of their massive stellar content. Some of the escaping (runaway) stars move through the ambient medium supersonically and can be revealed via detection of their bow shocks (visible in the infrared, optical or radio). In this paper, which is the second of a series of papers devoted to the search for OB stars running away from young ( ≲ several Myr) Galactic clusters and OB associations, we present the results of the search for bow shocks around the star-forming region NGC 6357. Using the archival data of the Midcourse Space Experiment (MSX) satellite and the Spitzer Space Telescope, and the preliminary data release of the Wide-Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE), we discovered seven bow shocks, whose geometry is consistent with the possibility that they are generated by stars expelled from the young (~1-2 Myr) star clusters, Pismis 24 and AH03 J1725-34.4, associated with NGC 6357. Two of the seven bow shocks are driven by the already known OB stars, HD 319881 and [N78] 34. Follow-up spectroscopy of three other bow-shock-producing stars showed that they are massive (O-type) stars as well, while the 2MASS photometry of the remaining two stars suggests that they could be B0 V stars, provided that both are located at the same distance as NGC 6357. Detection of numerous massive stars ejected from the very young clusters is consistent with the theoretical expectation that star clusters can effectively lose massive stars at the very beginning of their dynamical evolution (long before the second mechanism for production of runaway stars, based on a supernova explosion in a massive tight binary system, begins to operate) and lends strong support to the idea that probably all field OB stars have been dynamically ejected from their birth clusters. A by-product of our search for bow shocks around NGC 6357 is the detection of three circular shells typical of luminous blue variable and late WN-type Wolf-Rayet stars.},

@article{Battersby:2011aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Despite their profound effect on the universe, the formation of massive stars and stellar clusters remains elusive. Recent advances in observing facilities and computing power have brought us closer to understanding this formation process. In the past decade, compelling evidence has emerged that suggests infrared dark clouds (IRDCs) may be precursors to stellar clusters. However, the usual method for identifying IRDCs is biased by the requirement that they are seen in absorption against background mid-IR emission, whereas dust continuum observations allow cold, dense pre-stellar-clusters to be identified anywhere.  Aims: We aim to understand what dust temperatures and column densities characterize and distinguish IRDCs, to explore the population of dust continuum sources that are not IRDCs, and to roughly characterize the level of star formation activity in these dust continuum sources.  Methods: We use Hi-GAL 70 to 500 mum data to identify dust continuum sources in the l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ Hi-GAL science demonstration phase (SDP) fields, to characterize and subtract the Galactic cirrus emission, and perform pixel-by-pixel modified blackbody fits on cirrus-subtracted Hi-GAL sources. We utilize archival Spitzer data to indicate the level of star-forming activity in each pixel, from mid-IR-dark to mid-IR-bright.  Results: We present temperature and column density maps in the Hi-GAL l = 30$\,^{\circ}$ and l = 59$\,^{\circ}$ SDP fields, as well as a robust algorithm for cirrus subtraction and source identification using Hi-GAL data. We report on the fraction of Hi-GAL source pixels which are mid-IR-dark, mid-IR-neutral, or mid-IR-bright in both fields. We find significant trends in column density and temperature between mid-IR-dark and mid-IR-bright pixels; mid-IR-dark pixels are about 10 K colder and have a factor of 2 higher column density on average than mid-IR-bright pixels. We find that Hi-GAL dust continuum sources span a range of evolutionary states from pre- to star-forming, and that warmer sources are associated with more star formation tracers. Additionally, there is a trend of increasing temperature with tracer type from mid-IR-dark at the coldest, to outflow/maser sources in the middle, and finally to 8 and 24 mum bright sources at the warmest. Finally, we identify five candidate IRDC-like sources on the far-side of the Galaxy. These are cold (~20 K), high column density (N(H2) > 1022 cm-2) clouds identified with Hi-GAL which, despite bright surrounding mid-IR emission, show little to no absorption at 8 mum. These are the first inner Galaxy far-side candidate IRDCs of which the authors are aware.

	Abstract = {It is currently widely accepted that open star clusters and stellar associations result from the evolution of embedded star clusters. Parameters such star formation efficiency, time-scale of gas removal and velocity dispersion can be determinants of their future as bound or unbound systems. Finding objects at an intermediate evolution state can provide constraints to model the embedded cluster evolution. In the H II region IC 1396, Trumpler 37 is an extended young cluster that presents characteristics of an association. We employed the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) photometry for analysing its structure and stellar content, and determining its astrophysical parameters. We also analysed 11 bright-rimmed clouds in IC 1396 in order to search for young infrared star clusters, and the background open star cluster Teutsch 74, to verify whether it has any contribution to the observed stellar density profile of Trumpler 37. The derived parameters and comparison with template objects from other studies lead us to conclude that Trumpler 37, rather than as a star cluster, will probably emerge from its molecular cloud as an OB association.},

@article{Anderson:2012aa,
	Abstract = {Context. Because of their relatively simple morphology, "bubble" H II regions have been instrumental to our understanding of star formation triggered by H II regions. With the far-infrared (FIR) spectral coverage of the Herschel satellite, we can access the wavelengths where these regions emit the majority of their energy through their dust emission.  Aims: We wish to learn about the dust temperature distribution in and surrounding bubble H II regions and to calculate the mass and column density of regions of interest, in order to better understand ongoing star formation. Additionally, we wish to determine whether and how the spectral index of the dust opacity, beta, varies with dust temperature. Any such relationship would imply that dust properties vary with environment.  Methods: Using aperture photometry and fits to the spectral energy distribution, we determine the average temperature, beta-value, and mass for regions of interest within eight bubble H II regions. Additionally, we compute maps of the dust temperature and column density.  Results: At Herschel wavelengths (70 mum to 500 mum), the emission associated with H II regions is dominated by the cool dust in their photodissociation regions (PDRs). We find average dust temperatures of 26 K along the PDRs, with little variation between the H II regions in the sample, while local filaments and infrared dark clouds average 19 K and 15 K respectively. Higher temperatures lead to higher values of the Jeans mass, which may affect future star formation. The mass of the material in the PDR, collected through the expansion of the H II region, is between ~300 M&sun; and ~ 10 000 M&sun; for the H II regions studied here. These masses are in rough agreement with the expected masses swept up during the expansion of the H II regions. Approximately 20% of the total FIR emission is from the direction of the bubble central regions. This suggests that we are detecting emission from the "near-side" and "far-side" PDRs along the line of sight and that bubbles are three-dimensional structures. We find only weak support for a relationship between dust temperature and beta, of a form similar to that caused by noise and calibration uncertainties alone.

	Abstract = {Context. The temperature and density structure of molecular cloud cores are the most important physical quantities that determine the course of the protostellar collapse and the properties of the stars they form. Nevertheless, density profiles often rely either on the simplifying assumption of isothermality or on observationally poorly constrained model temperature profiles. The instruments of the Herschel satellite provide us for the first time with both the spectral coverage and the spatial resolution that is needed to directly measure the dust temperature structure of nearby molecular cloud cores.  Aims: With the aim of better constraining the initial physical conditions in molecular cloud cores at the onset of protostellar collapse, in particular of measuring their temperature structure, we initiated the guaranteed time key project (GTKP) "The Earliest Phases of Star Formation" (EPoS) with the Herschel satellite. This paper gives an overview of the low-mass sources in the EPoS project, the Herschel and complementary ground-based observations, our analysis method, and the initial results of the survey.  Methods: We study the thermal dust emission of 12 previously well-characterized, isolated, nearby globules using FIR and submm continuum maps at up to eight wavelengths between 100 mum and 1.2 mm. Our sample contains both globules with starless cores and embedded protostars at different early evolutionary stages. The dust emission maps are used to extract spatially resolved SEDs, which are then fit independently with modified blackbody curves to obtain line-of-sight-averaged dust temperature and column density maps.  Results: We find that the thermal structure of all globules (mean mass 7 M&sun;) is dominated by external heating from the interstellar radiation field and moderate shielding by thin extended halos. All globules have warm outer envelopes (14-20 K) and colder dense interiors (8-12 K) with column densities of a few 1022 cm-2. The protostars embedded in some of the globules raise the local temperature of the dense cores only within radii out to about 5000 AU, but do not significantly affect the overall thermal balance of the globules. Five out of the six starless cores in the sample are gravitationally bound and approximately thermally stabilized. The starless core in CB 244 is found to be supercritical and is speculated to be on the verge of collapse. For the first time, we can now also include externally heated starless cores in the Lsmm/Lbol vs. Tbol diagram and find that Tbol < 25 K seems to be a robust criterion to distinguish starless from protostellar cores, including those that only have an embedded very low-luminosity object.

	Abstract = {Context. The details of the process of massive star formation are still elusive. A complete characterization of the first stages of the process from an observational point of view is needed to constrain theories on the subject. In the past 20 years we have made a thorough investigation of colour-selected IRAS sources over the whole sky. The sources in the northern hemisphere were studied in detail and used to derive an evolutionary sequence based on their spectral energy distribution.  Aims: To investigate the first stages of the process of high-mass star formation, we selected a sample of massive clumps previously observed with the Swedish-ESO Submillimetre Telescope at 1.2 mm and with the ATNF Australia Telescope Compact Array at 1.3 cm. We want to characterize the physical conditions in such sources, and test whether their properties depend on the evolutionary stage of the clump.  Methods: With ATCA we observed the selected sources in the NH3(1, 1) and (2, 2) transitions and in the H2O(616-523) maser line. Ammonia lines are a very good temperature probe that allow us to accurately determine the mass and the column, volume, and surface densities of the clumps. We also collected all data available to construct the spectral energy distribution of the individual clumps and to determine if star formation is already occurring through observations of its most common signposts, thus putting constraints on the evolutionary stage of the source. We fitted the spectral energy distribution between 1.2 mm and 70 mum with a modified black body to derive the dust temperature and independently determine the mass.  Results: We find that the clumps are cold (T ~ 10-30 K), massive (M ~ 102-103 M&sun;), and dense (n(H2) ≳ 105 cm-3) and that they have high column densities (N(H2) ~ 1023 cm-2). All clumps appear to be potentially able to form high-mass stars. The most massive clumps appear to be gravitationally unstable, if the only sources of support against collapse are turbulence and thermal pressure, which possibly indicates that the magnetic field is important in stabilizing them.  Conclusions: After investigating how the average properties depend on the evolutionary phase of the source, we find that the temperature and central density progressively increase with time. Sources likely hosting a ZAMS star show a steeper radial dependence of the volume density and tend to be more compact than starless clumps.  Partly based on observations with the Herschel satellite.

	Abstract = {We present the first overview of the Herschel observations of the nearby high-mass star-forming region NGC 7538, taken as part of the Herschel imaging study of OB young stellar objects (HOBYS) Key Programme. These PACS and SPIRE maps cover an approximate area of one square degree at five submillimeter and far-infrared wavebands. We have identified 780 dense sources and classified 224 of those. With the intention of investigating the existence of cold massive starless or class 0-like clumps that would have the potential to form intermediate- to high-mass stars, we further isolate 13 clumps as the most likely candidates for follow-up studies. These 13 clumps have masses in excess of 40 M &sun; and temperatures below 15 K. They range in size from 0.4 pc to 2.5 pc and have densities between 3 × 103 cm-3 and 4 × 104 cm-3. Spectral energy distributions are then used to characterize their energetics and evolutionary state through a luminosity-mass diagram. NGC 7538 has a highly filamentary structure, previously unseen in the dust continuum of existing submillimeter surveys. We report the most complete imaging to date of a large, evacuated ring of material in NGC 7538 which is bordered by many cool sources.

@article{Benaglia:2013aa,
	Abstract = {Aims: The HII region RCW 49 and its ionizing cluster form an extensive, complex region that has been widely studied at infrared (IR) and optical wavelengths. The Molonglo 843 MHz and Australia Telescope Compact Array data at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz showed two shells. Recent high-resolution IR imaging revealed a complex dust structure and ongoing star formation. New high-bandwidth and high-resolution data of the RCW 49 field have been obtained to survey the radio emission at arcsec scale and investigate the small-scale features and nature of the HII region.  Methods: Radio observations were collected with the new 2-GHz bandwidth receivers and the CABB correlator of the Australia Telescope Compact Array [ATCA], at 5.5 and 9.0 GHz. In addition, archival observations at 1.4 and 2.4 GHz have been re-reduced and re-analyzed in conjunction with observations in the optical, IR, X-ray, and gamma-ray regimes.  Results: The new 2-GHz bandwidth data result in the most detailed radio continuum images of RCW 49 to date. The radio emission closely mimics the near-IR emission observed by Spitzer, showing pillars and filaments. The brightest continuum emission comes from the region known as the bridge. The overall flattish spectral index is typically consistent with a free-free emission mechanism. However, hints of nonthermal components are also present in the bridge. An interesting jet-like structure surrounded by a bubble feature whose nature is still unclear has been discovered close to the Westerlund 2 core. Two apparent bow shocks and a number of discrete sources have been detected as well in the surroundings of RCW 49. In addition, we also report on and discuss the possible detection of a hydrogen recombination line.  Conclusions: The radio results support an association between the cm continuum and molecular emission. The detection of the radio recombination line kinematically favors a RCW 49 distance of 6-7 kpc. If the negative spectral indices measured at the bridge should be confirmed to be caused by synchrotron emission, we propose a scenario where high-energy emission could be produced. Finally, the newly discovered jet-like structure appears to be an intriguing source that deserves a detailed study by itself.},

@article{Tan:2014aa,
	Abstract = {The enormous radiative and mechanical luminosities of massive stars impact a vast range of scales and processes, from the reionization of the universe, to the evolution of galaxies, to the regulation of the interstellar medium, to the formation of star clusters, and even to the formation of planets around stars in such clusters. Two main classes of massive star formation theory are under active study:  core accretion and competitive accretion. In core accretion, the initial conditions are self-gravitating, centrally concentrated cores that condense with a range of masses from the surrounding, fragmenting clump environment. They then undergo relatively ordered collapse via a central disk to form a single star or a small-N multiple. In this case, the prestellar core mass function has a similar form to the stellar initial mass function. In competitive accretion, the material that forms a massive star is drawn more chaotically from a wider region of the clump without passing through a phase of being in a massive, coherent core. In this case, massive star formation must proceed hand in hand with star cluster formation. If stellar densities become very high near the cluster center, then collisions between stars may also help to form the most massive stars. We review recent theoretical and observational progress toward understanding massive star formation, considering physical and chemical processes, comparisons with low and intermediate-mass stars, and connections to star cluster formation.},

	Abstract = {The southern Galactic high-mass star-forming region, G351.63-1.25, is an H II region-molecular cloud complex with a luminosity of ˜2.0 × 105 L&sun;, located at a distance of 2.4 kpc from the Sun. In this paper, we focus on the investigation of the associated H II region, embedded cluster and the interstellar medium in the vicinity of G351.63-1.25. We address the identification of exciting source(s) as well as the census of the stellar populations, in an attempt to unfold star formation activity in this region. The ionized gas distribution has been mapped using the Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India, at three frequencies: 1280, 610 and 325 MHz. The H II region shows an elongated morphology and the 1280 MHz map comprises six resolved high-density regions encompassed by diffuse emission spanning 1.4 × 1.0 pc2. Based on the measurements of flux densities at multiple radio frequencies, the brightest ultracompact core has electron temperature Te˜7647 {$\pm$} 153 K and emission measure, EM˜2.0 {$\pm$} 0.8×107 cm-6 pc. The zero-age main-sequence spectral type of the brightest radio core is O7.5. We have carried out near-infrared observations in the JHKs bands using the SIRIUS camera on the 1.4 m Infrared Survey Facility telescope. The near-infrared images reveal the presence of a cluster embedded in nebulous fan-shaped emission. The log-normal slope of the K-band luminosity function of the embedded cluster is found to be ˜0.27 $\pm$ 0.03, and the fraction of the near-infrared excess stars is estimated to be 43 per cent. These indicate that the age of the cluster is consistent with ˜1 Myr. Other available data of this region show that the warm (mid-infrared) and cold (millimetre) dust emission peak at different locations indicating progressive stages of star formation process. The champagne flow model from a flat, thin molecular cloud is used to explain the morphology of radio emission with respect to the millimetre cloud and infrared brightness.},

	Abstract = {Context. The two hot molecular cores Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N), which are located at the center of the giant molecular cloud complex Sagittarius B2, have been the targets of numerous spectral line surveys, revealing a rich and complex chemistry.  Aims: We seek to characterize the physical and chemical structure of the two high-mass star-forming sites Sgr B2(M) and Sgr B2(N) using high-angular resolution observations at millimeter wavelengths, reaching spatial scales of about 4000 au.  Methods: We used the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) to perform an unbiased spectral line survey of both regions in the ALMA band 6 with a frequency coverage from 211 GHz to 275 GHz. The achieved angular resolution is 0.̋4, which probes spatial scales of about 4000 au, i.e., able to resolve different cores and fragments. In order to determine the continuum emission in these line-rich sources, we used a new statistical method, STATCONT, which has been applied successfully to this and other ALMA datasets and to synthetic observations.  Results: We detect 27 continuum sources in Sgr B2(M) and 20 sources in Sgr B2(N). We study the continuum emission variation across the ALMA band 6 (i.e., spectral index) and compare the ALMA 1.3 mm continuum emission with previous SMA 345 GHz and VLA 40 GHz observations to study the nature of the sources detected. The brightest sources are dominated by (partially optically thick) dust emission, while there is an important degree of contamination from ionized gas free-free emission in weaker sources. While the total mass in Sgr B2(M) is distributed in many fragments, most of the mass in Sgr B2(N) arises from a single object, with filamentary-like structures converging toward the center. There seems to be a lack of low-mass dense cores in both regions. We determine H2 volume densities for the cores of about 107-109 cm-3 (or 105-107 M&sun; pc-3), i.e., one to two orders of magnitude higher than the stellar densities of super star clusters. We perform a statistical study of the chemical content of the identified sources. In general, Sgr B2(N) is chemically richer than Sgr B2(M). The chemically richest sources have about 100 lines per GHz and the fraction of luminosity contained in spectral lines at millimeter wavelengths with respect to the total luminosity is about 20%-40%. There seems to be a correlation between the chemical richness and the mass of the fragments, where more massive clumps are more chemically rich. Both Sgr B2(N) and Sgr B2(M) harbor a cluster of hot molecular cores. We compare the continuum images with predictions from a detailed 3D radiative transfer model that reproduces the structure of Sgr B2 from 45 pc down to 100 au.  Conclusions: This ALMA dataset, together with other ongoing observational projects in the range 5 GHz to 200 GHz, better constrain the 3D structure of Sgr B2 and allow us to understand its physical and chemical structure.  FITS files of the continuum images as well as the spectral index are available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr (http://130.79.128.5) or via http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/604/A6},

	Abstract = {The continuous radio spectrum from a spherical envelope in which the electron density is inversely proportional to the square of the radius is derived by solving the equation of radiative transfer, and the solution is also obtained in the general case where the electron density is inversely proportional to a variable power of the radius. The first case is given more attention since this may well represent the radio emission from the envelopes of stars undergoing mass loss. The optically thin portion of the envelope is found to produce the major part of the emission, and the radio spectrum and source size are found to have different power-law relationships to the frequency. It is shown that a measurement of the flux density can provide a good estimate of the loss rate, and such an estimate is derived for P Cyg. It is concluded that nebulae without a constant density may have continuous spectra very different from those of uniform spheres and that the spectra of uniform spheres correspond to about six times the emission of a black body at a temperature equal to the electron temperature.},

	Abstract = {IRAS 17256-3631 is a southern Galactic massive star-forming region located at a distance of 2 kpc. In this paper, we present a multiwavelength investigation of the embedded cluster, the H II region, as well as the parent cloud. Radio images at 325, 610 and 1372 MHz were obtained using Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope, India while the near-infrared imaging and spectroscopy were carried out using United Kingdom Infrared Telescope and Mt. Abu Infrared Telescope, India. The near-infrared K-band image reveals the presence of a partially embedded infrared cluster. The spectral features of the brightest star in the cluster, IRS-1, spectroscopically agree with a late O or early B star and could be the driving source of this region. Filamentary H2 emission detected towards the outer envelope indicates the presence of highly excited gas. The parent cloud is investigated at far-infrared to millimetre wavelengths and 18 dust clumps have been identified. The spectral energy distributions of these clumps have been fitted as modified blackbodies and the best-fitting peak temperatures are found to range from 14 to 33 K, while the column densities vary from 0.7 to 8.5 × 1022 cm-2. The radio maps show a cometary morphology for the distribution of ionized gas that is density bounded towards the north-west and ionization bounded towards the south-east. This morphology is better explained with the champagne flow model as compared to the bow-shock model. Using observations at near-, mid- and far-infrared, submillimetre and radio wavelengths, we examine the evolutionary stages of various clumps.},

@article{Mouschovias:1976aa,
	Abstract = {The paper studies the equilibrium of self-gravitating isothermal models of interstellar clouds with a frozen-in magnetic field linked smoothly to the field of a hot tenuous intercloud medium. Equilibrium states are determined which can be reached by clouds contracting nonhomologously from a spherical uniform initial state. Three free parameters characterize the problem: a dimensionless initial radius related to the Jeans length of the cloud, the initial ratio of the magnetic and gas pressures in the cloud, and the initial ratio of the intercloud and cloud pressures. The dependence of the solutions on each of these parameters is investigated. It is found that: (1) the frozen-in field causes the cloud to become oblate with its major axis normal to the field lines; (2) the flattening increases as the magnetic-field strength, gravitational forces, or intercloud pressure increases; (3) increasing intercloud pressure eventually leads to gravitational collapse; and (4) the cloud can reach equilibrium only if its radius does not exceed some critical value. The observed inefficiency of the star-formation process within massive clouds is examined and explained in terms of magnetic phenomena in a collapsing cloud.},

Analysis of the observations suggests that the easterly source is a region of recent star formation, while the westerly component appears to be older and to be produced by one star.},

All these jets have typical lengths of 2-4 x 10 to the 16th cm and small opening angles of 5 deg-10 deg. The observations strongly suggest that these jets are due to a highly collimated mass outflow. Their collimation must take place at distances smaller than 3 x 10 to the 15th cm from the jet sources. Many CO outflows observed near low to medium luminosity sources (0.1-100 solar luminosities) may be driven by jets, similar to the newly discovered ones.},

	Abstract = {Photometric, spectrophotometric and polarimetric data of the near infrared emission region in Cep-A are presented. This region is shown to be an infrared reflection nebula illuminated by a central source near the position of the H2O-maser spots. The extinction in front of this object rises steeply from east to west obscuring the central source by less than 75 mag. The steep extinction gradient determines the western edge of the reflection nebula, while the eastern edge is radiation limited. The optical depth along the axis of the bi-polar CO-mass outflow is relatively low. Nevertheless the spectral distribution of the radiation escaping into this direction shows (after scattering) deep 3.1 micron and 10 micron features. The supposed Herbig-Haro object GGD37 and the extended infrared source near this nebula are argued to be physically associated to this complex. A long-slit coude-spectrum of GGD37 obtained in the red reveals high velocity dispersions of at least 300 km/s, indicating powerful dynamical processes going on in this region. The relative strength of the forbidden line of S II 6717, 6731 lines compared to H-alpha and the forbidden line of N II suggests shock-excitation.},

These masers occur in four well-defined groups associated with four of the ultracompact H II regions in Cep A. From the present measurements it appears that the most compact of the H II regions is the source of the large-scale bipolar outflow which has been observed in CO, and that the outflow is collimated within ≡1015 cm of the central young star. The bipolar outflow is aligned in position angle with the interstellar magnetic field lines, and the collapsing molecular cloud is oriented at right angles to the field lines. A similar configuration is found in many other bipolar sources. This suggests that the interstellar magnetic field has played an important role in the evolution of these sources.},

Three individual condensations were detected in Cepheus A, one of them with a remarkably elongated shape. These condensations may play an important role in focusing the bipolar outflow in the region.

At lower resolution, four continuum sources were detected. Two of these sources coincide positionally with HH 1 and HH 2. At 6 cm and higher resolution, HH 1 is resolved into at least two components. The emission is probably bremsstrahlung originating in the same region where the visible line emission is produced. This is the first detection of radio continuum from classic Herbig-Haro objects. At a position closely centered between HH 1 and HH 2, an object that can be interpreted as the energy source of the system was detected. The central source spectrum is S(nu) of about nu to the alpha power, where alpha = 0.4 + or - 0.2, suggesting a stellar wind. Finally, the fourth radio continuum source coincides positionally with an H2O maser and is probably excited by an independent star. There is evidence of time variability in its radio flux. No emission was detected from the Cohen-Schwartz (1979) star at the 0.1 mJy level.},

	Abstract = {New observations of Cep A have been made at 6 cm and 20 cm with the VLA in the A configuration, providing angular resolution of 0.3 arcsec and 1 arcsec, respectively. Spectral indices show that optically thick regions are present in some of the 14 components previously detected, as would be expected if there were mass outflow. These components are the most compact ones, with radii of less than 100 AU, and have H2O masers associated with the edges of the H II regions and OH masers which are well outside. Even larger values of spectral index at shorter wavelengths and in the most compact components, as measured by others, lead to a model which shows that they are probably due to B3 stars at the end of their protostar stage, when accretion is ending, and the central star has become extended, presumably in a convective stage. Subsequently, the central star contracts, and the H II region grows as the result of a combination of radiation pressure and the pressure of the H II region. The radio continuum data shows no evidence for the central stars being the source of the bipolar outflow.},

The centrosymmetric pattern of the polarization vectors in each region is characteristic of reflection nebulae illuminated by a central source. The center of the polarization pattern in Cepheus A lies within a few arcseconds of the ultracompact H II regions and molecular masers believed to be the source of the bipolar outflow observed in CO and H2. The linear arrangement of the H II regions suggests that they are shock-heated jets that have been ejected from a young star located at the position of the polarization centroid, deeply embedded in the molecular cloud. In S140 the polarization is axisymmetric about the position of IRS 1 and reaches a maximum value at the position of IRS 2. This symmetry suggests that the outflow of high-velocity gas in S140 may be viewed nearly pole-on.},

	Abstract = {With the VLA the (2, 2) inversion transition line of NH3 was observed toward Cepheus A. Five small clumps were detected within the Cep A-1 and Cep A-3 ammonia condensations reported by Torrelles et al. (1983). Cep A-1 and Cep A-3 may be physically connected, thus constituting a very elongated structure with a length-to-width ratio of 13 to 1. The stellar activity center appears embedded within this structure. A comparison between the (2, 2) and (1, 1) ammonia emission reveals heating of the molecular gas close (less than about 3 arcsec) to the activity center. This result supports the interpretation that the knots seen in continuum are bright rims excited by one or two central stars. This is the first time that a direct map of the gas temperature has been obtained with the VLA, reflecting the quality of the system and suggesting the possibility of doing similar studies in other molecular clouds. It is found that the central heating source resides on the northwest face of the ammonia disklike structure. This is in the same direction that the redshifted CO outflow seems to be directed. It is suggested that this orientation of the central source with respect to a dense disk may explain the morphology of the outflow. It is proposed that the dense disk impedes the outflow in the southeast direction, while the outflow expands more freely in the northwest direction. Higher-resolution CO observations of the morphology of the outflow would provide a test for this model.},

They include five variable X-ray stars, seven near- or far-infrared sources, five stars visible on the Palomar Sky Survey, and ten sources with flat or ascending radio spectra. No optical T Tauri star is detected. The remaining sources are extragalactic, in agreement with radio-source counts. The stellar radio sources in the cloud constitute a population distinct from T Tauri stars, and they tend to have unusual infrared energy distributions. The authors suggest that they correspond to somewhat evolved young stars born in the cloud.},

	Abstract = {The theory of first order Fermi acceleration at collisionless astrophysical shock fronts is reviewed. Observations suggest that shock waves in different astrophysical environments accelerate cosmic rays efficiently. In the first order process, high energy particles diffuse through Alfv{\'e}n waves that scatter them and couple them to the background plasma. These particles gain energy, on the average, every time they cross the schock front and bounce off approaching scattering centers. Calculations demonstrate that the distribution function transmitted by a plane shock is roughly a power law in momentum with slope similar to that inferred in galactic cosmic ray sources. The generation of the scattering Alfv{\'e}n waves by the streaming cosmic rays is described and it is argued that the wave amplitude is probably non-linear within sufficiently strong astrophysical shocks. Hydromagnetic scattering can operate on the thermal particles as well, possibly establishing the shock structure. This suggests a model of strong collisionless shocks in which high energy particles are inevitably produced very efficiently. Observable consequences of this model, together with its limitations and some alternatives, are described. Cosmic ray origin and astrophysical shocks can no longer be considered separately.},

	Abstract = {The discovery of a new Herbig-Haro object 2 arcmin northeast of Cep A is reported. High proper motions for this object and of various H-alpha knots west of Cep A (in GGD 37), are deduced by comparing new H-alpha images with the Palomar sky survey. For a distance of 725 pc, tangential velocities of 110 to 250 km/s are derived which have their common origin near the compact H II regions 2 and 3 (Hughes, 1985). The resulting kinematic age is 1800 + or - 400 yr. A weak pointlike source (I = 20.6 mag) is detected at the position of the compact H II region 3a. No further source (I less than or equal to 23 mag) could be found in the region of radio continuum emission. However, an elongated feature of diffuse 1-micron emission is observed in line with the northern chain of compact radio knots, which is directed from the central source to the new Herbig-Hero object. It is concluded that a center of activity near the H2O maser positions is responsible for Cep A, drives the molecular outflow, and also excites the compact radio continuum knots and surrounding HH objects. The observed total luminosity and the 21-cm radio continuum data are consistent with a B0.5V star or three B1 V ZAMS stars.},

The lower velocity components are extended and, though not well collimated, can be divided into two sectors. Blue-shifted emission is dominant in the northeast of HW 2/3d, while redshifted emission is strong in the south and west. The displacement of the low-velocity CO is the same as that of other bipolar structures related to the outflow activity. These new data support the outflow hypothesis for the northeast-to-southwest structure, rather than the disk hypothesis. In this case, the low-velocity CO feature represents the cavity wall of the outflow.},

New observations made at 20 cm, 6 cm, and 2 cm show that there have been changes of at least 30 percent in the total flux from at least four of about 14 compact H II regions in Cep A East during 1982-1986. The results for one highly variable component indicate that large variations in ionization can possibly occur in a one-year period. The spectral indices of four of the more compact components indicate optically thick regions in their cores; together with the presence of OH and H2O maser emission, this indicates that some compact components are internally excited by starlike objects. The compact components probably represent the initial stages of formation of early main-sequence stars with mass greater than five solar.},

Elongated Herbig-Harolike emission is also found centered on XZ Tau.

A line joining the three components is directed towards a group of HH objects, but this is the only suggestion that there may be some interaction between them.

This object is located several arcminutes to the north of HH 34 and exhibits a unique morphology which consists of a long and narrow structure with approximate dimensions of 10 x 300 arcsec in optical photographs. A significant linearly polarized emission at 6 cm arising from near the core of the streamers has been detected, indicating uniform magnetic field geometry. This result suggests that the source responsible for producing the nebulosity is a nonthermal-emitting radio source. Because of the presence of a number of newly born low-mass stars in the vicinity of the streamers and because of the detection of a faint highly reddened 2-micron source coincident with the polarized radio emission, it is believed that the source at the core of the streamers is a low-luminosity young star responsible for both the synchrotron emission and the shock nebulosity.},

The dominant radio condensation in HH 1 and HH 2 and four additional sources in the field are detected.},

The radio proper motion of one object has been measured. In general, there is a displacement in position of the stronger radio and H-alpha objects, and this, together with H-alpha and H2 observations by others, enables some of the properties of the 'working volume' of the radiative shock producing them to be defined; it also enables a description to be made of the interface where it is suggested the high-velocity (about 1000 km/s) stellar wind is converted to the lower velocity (about 20 km/s) molecular outflow, and to define the direction of origin of the shock. The only other HH objects from which radio emission had been detected previously are HH 1-2, and more recently HH-80-81.},

A number of possible mechanisms for the origin of the radiation from both sources is discussed, but the resulting interpretation of the spectra is in terms of gyrosynchroton emission from thermal electrons at a temperature of about 10 exp 8 K, in a magnetic field about 200 G, and a region of size about 1 AU. The fact that the frequency of the peak emission moves to higher frequencies as the flux density increases is explained as an increase in the magnetic field and/or temperature of the electrons. The high temperature is consistent with the conversion of magnetic field energy into thermal energy, and this mechanism could also be instrumental to the production of molecular outflows.},

The proper motions are typically a few milliarcsec per year, and are mainly directed away from the central H II regions. Statistical analysis of the data suggests an expansion time-scale of some 300 yr. The distance of the source implied by the proper motions is 320+140/-80 pc, assuming that the expansion is isotropic. The proper motions can be reconciled with the larger distance of 730 pc which is generally accepted, provided that the masers are moving at large angles to the line of sight. The expansion time-scale agrees with that of the magnetic field decay recently reported by Cohen, et al. (1990).},

	Abstract = {Cepheus A remains a unique radio object. It consists of lines of about 13 H II regions, each of which, it was originally suggested, was produced by a B3 star. However, since the lifetime of each H II region was not expected to be greater than about 1000 years, it was difficult to explain how 13 stars could all be in the same stage of evolution inside such a short time interval, let alone why the stars should form in lines. Recently, two highly variable sources have been detected in the region, which can appear and disappear inside a time interval of about 50-80 days. Some of the data show that in a line of four objects, one is moving at a speed of 300 km/s with respect to the others. The latter aspects appear similar to those of some Herbig-Haro objects, but in the case of Cepheus A, the objects are in line with one of the highly variable sources, which could be the power house. It could be that much later type stars than B3, which have excess infrared emission and are in a very turbulent stage are being observed.},

In this paper, the authors explore whether these spectral indices could be obtained from sources of free-free emission with ad hoc electron density and temperature distributions. They find that, if only free-free emission and absorption are involved, the spectral index will always be alpha >= -0.1 regardless of the source characteristics. Finally, the authors explore the possibility that the large negative spectral indices could be produced by dust absorption. However, the very high column densities required lead them to conclude that the large negative indices found in these peculiar sources are more naturally explained in terms of optically thin synchrotron emission.},

	Abstract = {We present multifrequency, matching-beam VLA continuum observations of the HH 80-81 system as well as high-resolution observations of its central exciting source. A highly collimated bipolar jet emanates from this central source along a line between the source and HH 80-81. The jet consists of a multitude of knots, with a spacing of about 1400 AU and widths of less than 500 AU. This is strikingly similar to the structure of HH jets emanating from young stars more than a thousand times less luminous. The southern lobe terminates in the visible HH objects HH 80-81 at a projected distance of 2.3 pc from the central source. These objects are detected and resolved at 6 cm and 3.6 cm with a spectral index of alpha = -0.3. We find another resolved object 3.0 pc to the north of the source along the well-defined flow axis and with the same negative spectral index, but without any known optical counterpart.  We here call this object HH 80 North. The total projected dimension of 5.3 pc for this highly collimated outflow complex far exceeds all other known HH complexes and is more than an order of magnitude larger than the typical dimensions of such flows. There is clear evidence for a gentle wiggling of the flow axis, suggesting that the driving source may be precessing. The remarkable structural similarity between the HH 80-81 jet and HH jets from low luminosity stars suggests that massive newborn stars pass through very similar evolutionary phases.},

	Abstract = {The relationship between optical outflows, as represented by Herbig-Haro (HH) objects and HH-like jets, and their associated molecular outflows is not well known. While molecular outflows are in many instances poorly collimated, this may not be true of HH outflows and it is certainly not the case with jets. Here we examine, through direct imaging and spectroscopy, the optical flow in the region east of Cepheus A, a well known molecular outflow source. Our images reveal several previously unseen HH objects in this region linked together by a virtual ellipse of HH eimssion. The major axis of this 'ellipse' points directly at what is thought to be the driving source of activity in this area and it is argued that the optical, shocked molecular hydrogen, and radio emission all derive from a poorly collimated wind from Cep A. As with the optical outflow to the west of Cep A, the bow shaped emission, seen in the case of the two brightest HH objects, suggests a clumpy wind at least near the interface between the wind and the ambient material. The idea that there is more than one major outflow direction in the Cep A region is examined. We find that the evidence presented here and at various other wavelenghts supports a simple east-west orientation.},

We present multifrequency very large array (VLA) radio continuum observations of Cep A HW2, the elongated radio object believed to be associated with te most luminous (approximately 104 solar luminosity)source in the region. In the frequency range from 1.5 to 43 GHz, we find that its flux density increases with frequency as nu 0.69, while the angular size of its major axis decreases with frequency as nu-0.57. The above frequency dependences are very close to the theoretical values of nu0.6 and nu-0.7 expected for a biconical thermal jet and make Cep A HW2 the best example known of this type of object. We suggest that Cep A HW2 is responsible for at least part of the complex outflow and excitation phenomena observed in the region. The estimated ionized mass-loss rate in this source, approximately 8 x 10 -7 solar mass per year, is about 100 times larger than the value expected for a star of the same luminosity in the main sequence.},

	Abstract = {New high-resolution 6-cm observations have been made of Cepheus A using MERLIN, and combined with new VLA observations at 3.6cm. The angular resolution with the latter was 200 mas, and with MERLIN was 60 mas, except for isolated unresolved sources where 33 mas wasachieved. Unresolved objects at 60 mas were observed in Sources 2, 3,and in particular 9 which also was not resolved at 33 mas. There is no evidence for any other object as small as this with any significant flux density, although Source 8 was quiescent at the time. The upper limit to the size of Source 9 sets a minimum brightness temperature of 4.3x 10^5 K, and adds credence to a previous suggestion that it is a gyrosynchrotron source. The compact objects of Sources 2 and 3 are thought to be produced by mass outflow from stars, which could be of spectral type B0 - B1, but this is uncertain. The powerhouse for the molecular outflow is discussed. Sources 8 and 9, which are the highly time-dependent objects,appear at the centre of the disruption of the high-density gas, and their estimated high temperature of 10^7 - 10^8 K indicates that they could produce high-velocity winds. On the other hand, the OH masers surrounding Source 2(ii) show an outward velocity of about 10 kms^-1, which is small, but higher velocity winds could tunnel through adjacent spaces, and even be responsible for the 300 km s^-1 'bullet'of Source 7. An extrapolation of the orthogonals to the IR polarization vectors is not accurate enough to pinpoint the source of the IR radiation, but it is estimated that Sources 2(ii) and 3(d)(ii) could supply the illumination. It is concluded that the two phenomena of molecular outflow and IR luminosity are not necessarily associated with one type of object only, but could be manifestations of two different types of object.},

	Abstract = {We present a study of the radio continuum source found near the position of the H2O masers and the Turner-Welch (TW) source in the W3(OH) region. The source spectrum from 1.6 to 15 GHz exhibits a power law with spectral index -0.6. The continuum source is elongated in the east-west direction and its decreases linearly with increasing frequency. These observations provide strong evidence for synchrotron emission from an inhomogeneous source. The elongated continuum source is coincident within 0.1 arcsec of the center of expansion of the H2O masers and is aligned with the dominant H2O outflow pattern. A possible model for the system includes an early-type star with a fast collimated wind that drives a jetlike outflow.

The elongation seen previously in Cep A2 appears to extend even farther in our map, supporting a jet interpretation for the morphology of this source. We discuss this and alternative mechanisms in the context of the large-scale outflows in the Cep A region. The 1.6 GHz map of LkHalpha 101 is more symmetric, although it does show a bright bar of emission at P.A. ≈ 135$\,^{\circ}$ plus other extended structures.

	Abstract = {A mechanism is sought by which cosmic rays could be inhibited from entering dense molecular hydrogen clouds in the Galaxy as a whole and at the galactic center. Analysis indicates that Alfven waves generated outside dense clouds by the net flux of cosmic rays into the clouds are most effective at excluding cosmic rays below a few hundred MeV in energy, that the MeV cosmic rays which are most effective in ionizing cloud material are excluded very efficiently, and that the intensity of particles with energy of about 1 MeV is reduced by a factor of approximately 25. The reduction in gamma-ray flux (via neutral-pion decay) caused by the Alfven waves is computed for two different values of ambient cosmic-ray intensity and cloud depth. The results are applied to clouds in the Galaxy and in the galactic-center region.},

First, the review briefly summarizes classes of theoretical models of molecular clouds and specific predictions of the models that can be tested by observation. Then, the review describes the techniques for observing and mapping magnetic fields in molecular clouds, followed by discussion of important examples of observational studies using each technique. A synthesis of results from all observational techniques summarizes the current state, which is that though magnetic fields generally dominate turbulence, there is no definitive evidence for magnetic fields dominating gravity in molecular clouds or for ambipolar-diffusion-driven star formation. Finally, the review discusses prospects for advances in our observational capabilities with telescopes and instruments now beginning operation or under construction.},

The spectra (formed in the clouds) of primary cosmic rays penetrating from outside are calculated, and the generation of secondary particles (antiprotons, pions, muons, electrons and positrons) inside the clouds is investigated. The gamma-ray emission from these molecular clouds has been estimated. It is shown that using this model one can explain the observed flux of the unidentified gamma-ray sources discovered by COS-B. The synchrotron radio emission of accelerated primary and secondary electrons in molecular clouds is calculated.

	Abstract = {This paper reports bolometric observations of dust emission from the giant star-forming H II/giant molecular cloud (GMC) complex Sgr B2, made at lambda 1300 micrometers and lambda 870 micrometer with the 30 m radio telescope of Institut de Radio Astronomie Millimetrique (IRAM) and at lambda 1300 micrometer and lambda 2.9 mm with the 15 m radio telescope of Swedish-ESO Submillimeter Telescope (SEST). Three compact (less than or equal to 0.4 pc) components of dust emission N(orth) = FIR1, M(iddle) = FIR2, and S(outh) = FIR3 are embedded within an extensive (4 pc x 11 pc) lower-density envelope. Combining the flux densities from our observations - corrected for free-free emission and molecular line emission - with others reported in the literature, we have produced continuum spectra for the integrated dust emission of the Sgr B2 complex and its 3 principal components. Based upon a spatial and spectral decomposition we determine the physical characteristics of the 4 components. We present and discuss new IRAS images of Sgr B2 and its surroundings. Sgr B2 appears in the lambda 100 micrometer and lambda 60 micrometer images as emission maxima where the lambda 100 micrometer/lambda 60 micrometer color temperature attains a value of about 35K. It appears that the dust inside this envelope of Sgr B2, seen at millimeter and submillimeter wavelengths, is too cold to be visible in the IRAS images that mainly trace the warmer diffuse dust and the dust in the outer skin of GMCs.},

	Abstract = {We have made a new calculation of the cosmic-ray secondary positron spectrum using a diffusive halo model for Galactic cosmic-ray propagation. The code computes self-consistently the spectra of primary and secondary nucleons, primary electrons, and secondary positrons and electrons. The models are first adjusted to agree with the observed cosmic-ray boron/carbon ratio, and the interstellar proton and helium spectra are then computed; these spectra are used to obtain the source function for the secondary positrons/electrons that are finally propagated with the same model parameters. The primary electron spectrum is evaluated, again using the same model. Fragmentation and energy losses are computed using realistic distributions for the interstellar gas and radiation fields, and diffusive reacceleration is also incorporated. Our study includes a critical reevaluation of the secondary decay calculation for positrons.  The predicted positron fraction is in good agreement with the measurements up to 10 GeV, beyond which the observed flux is higher than that calculated. Since the positron fraction is now measured accurately in the 1-10 GeV range, our primary electron spectrum should be a good estimate of the true interstellar spectrum in this range, of interest for gamma-ray and solar modulation studies. We further show that a harder interstellar nucleon spectrum, similar to that suggested to explain EGRET diffuse Galactic gamma-ray observations above 1 GeV, can reproduce the positron observations above 10 GeV without requiring a primary positron component.},

@article{Mayer-Hasselwander:1998aa,
	Abstract = {The EGRET instrument on the Compton Gamma-Ray Observatory has observed the Galactic Center (GC) region with good coverage at a number of epochs. A strong excess of emission is observed, peaking at energies > 500 MeV in an error circle of 0.2 degree radius including the position l=0(deg) and b=0(deg) . The close coincidence of this excess with the GC direction and the fact that it is the strongest emission maximum within 15 degrees from the GC is taken as compelling evidence for the source's location in the GC region. The history of the emission intensity, observed over 5 years, leaves room for possible time variation; however, it does not provide evidence. The angular extent of the excess appears only marginally compatible with the signature expected for a single compact object. The emission therefore may stem from one or more compact objects or may originate from diffuse interactions within 85 pc from the center of the Galaxy at 8.5 kpc distance. The spatial distribution of the emission does not correlate with the details of the CO-line surveys. Thus, in spite of the existence of a strong emission peak, earlier conclusions based on an apparent `gamma-ray deficit', postulating the masses of the `wide-line' clouds in the GC area to be an order of magnitude lower than indicated by naive CO interpretation, are supported. However, the total gas mass in the Nuclear Bulge (NB) derived from the gamma-ray emission is found to be in agreement with the mass which in recent studies has been derived from molecular-line and FIR surveys. The gamma -ray emission spectrum is peculiar and different from the spectrum of the large-scale galactic diffuse emission. A diffuse emission scenario requires an enhanced and peculiar Cosmic Ray (CR) spectrum as suggested for the electrons in the `Radio Arc'. A compact sources model hints at an origin in pulsars. While the spectrum suggests middle-aged pulsars like Vela, too many are required to produce the observed flux. The only detected very young pulsar, the Crab pulsar, has an incompatible spectrum. However, it is not proven that the Crab spectrum is characteristic for all young pulsars: thus, a single or a few very young pulsars (at the GC not detectable in radio emission), provided their gamma-ray emission is larger than that of the Crab pulsar by a factor of 13, are likely candidates. Alternatively, more exotic scenarios, related to the postulated central black hole or dark matter (neutralino) annihilation, may be invoked.},

	Abstract = {This paper presents a summary of all 27 available sensitive Zeeman measurements of magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds together with other relevant physical parameters. From these data input parameters to magnetic star formation theory are calculated, and predictions of theory are compared with observations. Results for this cloud sample are the following: (1) Internal motions are supersonic but approximately equal to the Alfv{\'e}n speed, which suggests that supersonic motions are likely MHD waves. (2) The ratio of thermal to magnetic pressures betap~0.04, implying that magnetic fields are important in the physics of molecular clouds. (3) The mass-to-magnetic flux ratio is about twice critical, which suggests but does not require that static magnetic fields alone are insufficient to support clouds against gravity. (4) Kinetic and magnetic energies are approximately equal, which suggests that static magnetic fields and MHD waves are roughly equally important in cloud energetics. (5) Magnetic field strengths scale with gas densities as |B|~rhokappa with kappa~0.47 this agrees with the prediction of ambipolar diffusion driven star formation, but this scaling may also be predicted simply by Alfv{\'e}nic motions. The measurements of magnetic field strengths in molecular clouds make it clear that magnetic fields are a crucial component of the physics governing cloud evolution and star formation.},

The X-ray spectrum and the morphology are well reproduced by a scenario that X-rays from an external source located in the Galactic center direction are scattered by the molecular cloud Sgr B2 and come into our line of sight.

	Abstract = {A measurement of the energy spectra of cosmic-ray positrons and electrons was made with a balloon-borne magnet-spectrometer, which was flown at a mean geomagnetic cut-off of 4.5 GV/c. The observed positron flux in the energy range 7-16 GeV is approximately an order of magnitude lower than that of electrons, as measured in other experiments at various energies. The power law spectral index of the observed differential energy spectrum of electrons is -2.89 +/- 0.10 in the energy interval 7.5-47 GeV. For positrons the overall fit of the available data above 7 GeV has been considered. The spectral index is found to be -3.37 +/- 0.26 and the fraction of positrons, e+/(e+,+ e-), has a mean value of 0.064 +/- 0.003. The world data on e+/(e+,+ e-) from 0.1 to 30 GeV indicate that a plerion type electron spectrum is preferred over the other types. The trend of the presently existing high energy data also suggests a possible contribution of positrons produced at the pulsar polar cap. High resolution experiments capable of identifying positrons at least up to 100 GeV with high statistics are required to pinpoint the origin of both electrons and positrons in the cosmic radiation.},

	Abstract = {We present the highest resolution and sensitivity low frequency image (<  300 MHz) of the Galactic center to date using the Very Large Array at 74 MHz  in its A, B, C, & D configurations. The resulting images have a resolution  of 2.1' x 1.2' and a dynamic range of ~400. From these data we have been able  to identify a region of enhanced 74 MHz emission about 5 degrees in extent that  is coincident with the high density molecular gas surrounding the Galactic  center known as the Central Molecular Zone. In addition to giving an  unprecedented view of the extended nonthermal emission surrounding the  Galactic center, the 74 MHz image shows deep free-free absorption across the  Galactic center itself, as well as, part of the Galactic center radio lobe,  and a number of H II regions in the field. This absorption is due to ionized  thermal gas in front of, or in some cases embedded in, the nonthermal Galactic  center (GC) emission. Such absorption allows us to unambiguously place some  of the H II regions in the direction of the GC along the line of sight for the  first time. The morphology, nature, and relationship to  the Galactic center of the 74 MHz absorption and emission is discussed.},

The data presented here are compatible with our previous measurements, obtained with a different instrument. The combined data from the three HEAT flights indicate a small positron flux of nonstandard origin above 5GeV. We compare the new measurement with earlier data obtained with the HEAT-e$\pm$ instrument, during the opposite epoch of the solar cycle, and conclude that our measurements do not support predictions of charge sign dependent solar modulation of the positron abundance at 5GeV.},

	Abstract = {We study the hard X-ray (20-100 keV) variability of the Galactic Center (GC) and of the nearby sources on the time scale of 1000 s. We find that 3 of the 6 hard X-ray sources detected by INTEGRAL within the central 1 degree of the Galaxy are not variable on this time scale: the GC itself (the source IGR J1745.6-2901) as well as the source 1E 1743.1-2843 and the molecular cloud Sgr B2. We put an upper limit of 5 x 10^{-12} erg/(cm^2 sec) (in 20 to 60 keV band) on the variable emission form the supermassive black hole (the source Sgr A*) which powers the activity of the GC(although we can not exclude the possibility of rare stronger flares). The non-variable 20-100 keV emission from the GC turns out to be the high-energy non-thermal tail of the diffuse hard ``8 keV'' component of emission from Sgr A region. Combining the XMM-Newton and INTEGRAL data we find that the size of the extended hard X-ray emission region is about 20 pc. The only physical mechanism of production of diffuse non-thermal hard X-ray flux, which does not contradict the multi-wavelength data on the GC, is the synchrotron emission from electrons of energies 10-100 TeV.},

@article{Fryer:2006aa,
	Abstract = {Using a combination of one-dimensional and three-dimensional hydrodynamic simulations, we have carried out the first in-depth analysis of the remnant's evolution and its various interactions: with the stellar winds flowing out from the inner ~2 pc; with the supermassive black hole, Sgr A*; and with the 50 km s-1 molecular cloud behind and to the east of the nucleus. We have found that, unlike previous estimates, a rather ``standard'' supernova explosion with energy ~1.5×1051 ergs would have been sufficient to create the remnant we see today and that the latter is probably only ~1700 yr old. We have found that the passage of the remnant across the black hole would have enhanced the accretion rate onto the central object by less than a factor of 2. Such a small increase cannot explain the current Fe fluorescence observed from the molecular cloud Sgr B2; this fluorescence would have required an increase in the luminosity of Sgr A* by 6 orders of magnitude several hundred years ago. Instead, we have uncovered what appears to be a more plausible scenario for this transient irradiation: the interaction between the expanding remnant and the 50 km s-1 molecular cloud. The first impact would have occurred about 1200 yr after the explosion, producing a 2-200 keV luminosity of ~1039 ergs s-1. During the intervening 300-400 yr, the dissipation of kinetic energy subsided considerably, leading to the much lower luminosity (~1036 ergs s-1 at 2-10 keV) we see today.},

	Abstract = {We present a measurement of the sky distribution of positronium (Ps) annihilation continuum emission obtained with the SPI spectrometer on board ESA's INTEGRAL observatory. The only sky region from which significant Ps continuum emission is detected is the Galactic bulge. The Ps continuum emission is circularly symmetric about the Galactic centre, with an extension of about 8$\,^{\circ}$ FWHM. Within measurement uncertainties, the sky distribution of the Ps continuum emission is consistent with that found by us for the 511 keV electron-positron annihilation line using SPI. Assuming that 511 keV line and Ps continuum emission follow the same spatial distribution, we derive a Ps fraction of 0.92$\pm$0.09. These results strengthen our conclusions regarding the origin of positrons in our Galaxy based on observations of the 511 keV line. In particular, they suggest that the main source of Galactic positrons is associated with an old stellar population, such as Type Ia supernovae, classical novae, or low-mass X-ray binaries. Light dark matter is a possible alternative source of positrons.},

	Abstract = {Context: .The cosmic-ray ionization rate zetaCR of dense molecular clouds is a key parameter for their dynamics and chemistry. Aims: .Variations of zetaCR are well established, but it is unclear if these are related to source column density or to Galactic location. Methods: .Using the APEX telescope, we have mapped the 364 GHz line of H3O+ in the Sgr B2 region and observed the 307 GHz line at selected positions. With the IRAM 30-m telescope we have observed the H218O 203 GHz line at the same positions. Results: .Strong H3O+ emission is detected over a ~3 × 2 pc region, indicating an H3O+ column density of 1015-1016 cm-2 in an 18'' beam. The H3O+ abundance of ~ 3 × 10-9 and H3O+/H2O ratio of ~1/50 in the Sgr B2 envelope are consistent with models with zetaCR ~ 4 × 10-16 s-1, 3× lower than derived from H3+ observations toward Sgr A, but 10× that of local dense clouds. Conclusions: .The ionization rates of interstellar clouds thus seem to be to first order determined by the ambient cosmic-ray flux, while propagation effects cause a factor of ~3 decrease from diffuse to dense clouds.},

If these positrons are injected at even mildly relativistic energies, higher-energy gamma rays will also be produced.

	Abstract = {The inner couple of hundred parsecs of our Galaxy are characterized by a significant amount of synchrotron-emitting gas. Many of the best studied sources in this region exhibit a mixture of 6.4 keV Fe Kalpha emission, molecular line emission, and nonthermal radio continuum radiation. The spatial correlation between fluorescent Fe Kalpha line emission at 6.4 keV and molecular line emission from Galactic center molecular clouds has been explained as reflected X-rays from a past outburst of Sgr A*. Here we present a multiwavelength study of this region and find a correlation between the nonthermal radio filaments and the X-ray features. This correlation, when combined with the distribution of molecular gas, suggests against the irradiation model. Instead, we account for this distribution in terms of the impact of the relativistic particles from local (nonthermal filaments) and extended sources with diffuse neutral gas producing both nonthermal bremsstrahlung X-ray continuum emission and diffuse 6.4 keV line emission. The production rate of Fe Kalpha photons associated with the injection of electrons into a cloud as a function of column density is calculated. The required energy density of low-energy cosmic rays associated with the synchrotron-emitting radio filaments or extended features is estimated to be in the range between 20 and ~103 eV cm-3 for Sgr C, Sgr B1, Sgr B2, and ``the 45 and -30 km s-1'' clouds. We also generalize this idea to explain the cosmic-ray heating of molecular gas, the interstellar cosmic-ray ionization, the pervasive production of the diffuse Kalpha line, and TeV emission from the Galactic center molecular clouds. In particular, we suggest that inverse Compton scattering of the submillimeter radiation from dust by relativistic electrons may contribute substantially to the large-scale diffuse TeV emission observed toward the central regions of the Galaxy.},

@article{Cheng:2007aa,
	Abstract = {We suggest that the energy source of the observed diffuse gamma-ray emission from the direction of the Galactic center is the Galactic black hole Sgr A*, which becomes active when a star is captured at a rate of ~10-5 yr-1. Subsequently the star is tidally disrupted and its matter is accreted into the black hole. During the active phase relativistic protons with a characteristic energy ~ 6 × 1052 erg per capture are ejected. Over 90% of these relativistic protons disappear due to proton-proton collisions on a timescale tau _pp ~ 104 years in the small central bulge region with radius ~50 pc within Sgr A*, where the density is >=103 cm-3. The gamma-ray intensity, which results from the decay of neutral pions produced by proton-proton collisions, decreases according to e-t/tau _pp, where t is the time after last stellar capture. Less than 5% of relativistic protons escaped from the central bulge region can survive and maintain their energy for >107 years due to much lower gas density outside, where the gas density can drop to ~1 cm-3. They can diffuse to a ~500 pc region before disappearing due to proton-proton collisions. The observed diffuse GeV gamma-rays resulting from the decay of neutral pions produced via collision between these escaped protons and the gas in this region is expected to be insensitive to time in the multi-injection model with the characteristic injection rate of 10-5 yr-1. Our model calculated GeV and 511 keV gamma-ray intensities are consistent with the observed results of EGRET and INTEGRAL, however, our calculated inflight annihilation rate cannot produce sufficient intensity to explain the COMPTEL data.},

	Abstract = {We summarize three recent publications which suggest that the Galactic center region Sagittarius B (Sgr B) may contain non-thermal radio components (Crocker et al. 2007, Hollis et al. 2007 and Yusef-Zadeh et al. 2007a). Based on new VLA matched-resolution continuum data at 327 MHz and 1.4 GHz, we find no evidence for large scale non-thermal radio emission at these frequencies; the spectral behavior is likely determined by the complex summation of multiple HII region components with a wide range of emission measures and hence radio turn-over frequencies. Also, we discuss a possible additional interpretation of the radio continuum spectrum of individual component Sgr B2-F carried out by Yusef-Zadeh et al; confusion from nearby HII components with widely different turn-over frequencies may contribute to the the change in slope of the radio continuum in this direction at low frequencies. Finally, we discuss the uncertainties in the determination of the spectral index of the GBT continuum data of Sgr B carried out by Hollis et al. We find that the apparent spectral index determined by their procedure is also likely due to a summation over the many diverse thermal components in this direction.},

	Abstract = {A mapping study of 71 Planck cold clumps was made with 12CO(1-0), 13CO(1-0), and C18O(1-0) lines at the 13.7 m telescope of Purple Mountain Observatory. For all the clumps, 12CO(1-0) and 13CO(1-0) emissions were detected, while for 55 of them, C18O(1-0) emissions were detected. Of the 71 Clumps, 34 are in the Taurus Complex, 24 in the California Complex, and 13 are in the Perseus Complex. In the 76 velocity components, 38 cores are found in 27 clumps; 19 of these cores are in the Taurus Complex, 16 in the California Complex, and 3 in the Perseus Complex. We acquired V lsr, TA and FWHM of lines. Physical parameters including T ex, N_H_2, sigmaTherm, sigmaNT, and sigma3D were calculated. Generally, the cores are of T ex = 2-16 K, N_H_2 = 10^{21}{--}10^{22} cm-2, and sigma3D = 0.2-1.0 km s-1. In the Taurus Complex, the cores are less dense on average and have smaller sigmaTherm than the cores in the Perseus and California Complexes. Two of the three cores in the Perseus Complex are revealed to have larger T ex, N_H_2, and sigma3D than the mean values in the other two regions. Most of the cores have sigmaNT larger than sigmaTherm, suggesting a dominance of turbulence in our cores. The majority of the cores have M vir/M LTE Gt 1, which indicates these cores are not bound and will disperse. By comparing our results with the dust properties revealed by the Planck Early Release Cold Cores Catalog, we investigated the coupling of gas and dust components. We found that most of the cores have dust temperatures higher than their gas temperatures. The stellar objects associated with our sources were checked and 90% of the cores were found to be starless.},

@article{Zapata:2011aa,
	Abstract = {During their infancy, stars are well known to expel matter violently in the form of well-defined, collimated outflows. A fairly unique exception is found in the Orion Becklin-Neugebauer/Kleinmann-Low star-forming region where a poorly collimated and somewhat disordered outflow composed of numerous elongated "finger-like" structures was discovered more than 30 years ago. In this Letter, we report the discovery in the same region of an even more atypical outflow phenomenon. Using <SUP>13</SUP>CO(2-1) line observations made with the Submillimeter Array, we have identified there a 500-1000 year old, expanding, roughly spherically symmetric bubble whose characteristics are entirely different from those of known outflows associated with young stellar objects. The center of the bubble coincides with the initial position of a now defunct massive multiple stellar system suspected to have disintegrated 500 years ago and with the center of symmetry of the system of molecular fingers surrounding the Kleinmann-Low nebula. We hypothesize that the bubble is made up of gas and dust that used to be part of the circumstellar material associated with the decayed multiple system. The Orion hot core, recently proposed to be the result of the impact of a shock wave onto a massive dense core, is located toward the southeast quadrant of the bubble. The supersonic expansion of the bubble and/or the impact of some low-velocity filaments provide a natural explanation for its origin.},

The observed HC3N emission shows an elongated shape around the Principal Cloud (~4.5 pc in R.A. X 7.4 pc in Decl.). The optically thin H13CCCN line peaks around the (N) core and we derive the total column density N(H13CCCN) = 4 X 10^13 cm^(-2) at this position. Toward the 2' N cloud which shows the peculiar chemistry, the HC3N lines show enhancements compared to the extended envelope. The shocks of the 2' N may have resulted in the enhancement of HC3N. The hot component of HC3N is strongly concentrated around the (N) core and its HPW is ~0.9 pc in diameter. We derive the lower limit of the abundance ratio N(HC3N)/N(H13CCCN) to be larger than 40 in most regions except the (M) and (N) cores. The fractionation of 13C at this region may not be as effective as previously reported.},

	Abstract = {We present SiO J = 2-1 maps of the Sgr B2 molecular cloud, which show shocked gas with a turbulent substructure comprising at least three cavities at velocities of $[10,40]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ and an arc at velocities of $[-20,10]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ . The spatial anticorrelation of shocked gas at low and high velocities, and the presence of bridging features in position-velocity diagrams suggest that these structures formed in a cloud-cloud collision. Some of the known compact H II regions spatially overlap with sites of strong SiO emission at velocities of $[40,85]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , and are between or along the edges of SiO gas features at $[100,120]\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , suggesting that the stars responsible for ionizing the compact H II regions formed in compressed gas due to this collision. We find gas densities and kinetic temperatures of the order of $n_ \rm H_2 \sim 10^5\, \rm cm^ -3 $ and $\sim 30\, \rm K$ , respectively, towards three positions of Sgr B2. The average values of the SiO relative abundances, integrated line intensities, and line widths are ˜10<SUP>-9</SUP>, $\sim 11\, \rm K\, km\, s^ -1 $ , and $\sim 31\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ , respectively. These values agree with those obtained with chemical models that mimic grain sputtering by C-type shocks. A comparison of our observations with hydrodynamical simulations shows that a cloud-cloud collision that took place $\lesssim 0.5\, \rm Myr$ ago can explain the density distribution with a mean column density of $\bar N _ \rm H_2 \gtrsim 5\times 10^ 22 \, \rm cm^ -2 $ , and the morphology and kinematics of shocked gas in different velocity channels. Colliding clouds are efficient at producing internal shocks with velocities $\sim 5\!-\!50\, \rm km\, s^ -1 $ . High-velocity shocks are produced during the early stages of the collision and can readily ignite star formation, while moderate- and low-velocity shocks are important over longer time-scales and can explain the widespread SiO emission in Sgr B2.},

	Abstract = {Context. The role of ionization feedback on high-mass (&gt;8 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>) star formation is still highly debated. Questions remain concerning the presence of nearby H II regions changes the properties of early high-mass star formation and whether H II regions promote or inhibit the formation of high-mass stars. <BR /> Aims: To characterize the role of H II regions on the formation of high-mass stars, we study the properties of a sample of candidates high-mass starless clumps (HMSCs), of which about 90% have masses larger than 100 M<SUB>⊙</SUB>. These high-mass objects probably represent the earliest stages of high-mass star formation; we search if (and how) their properties are modified by the presence of an H II region. <BR /> Methods: We took advantage of the recently published catalog of HMSC candidates. By cross matching the HMSCs and H II regions, we classified HMSCs into three categories: (1) the HMSCs associated with H II regions both in the position in the projected plane of the sky and in velocity; (2) HMSCs associated in the plane of the sky, but not in velocity; and (3) HMSCs far away from any H II regions in the projected sky plane. We carried out comparisons between associated and nonassociated HMSCs based on statistical analyses of multiwavelength data from infrared to radio. <BR /> Results: We show that there are systematic differences of the properties of HMSCs in different environments. Statistical analyses suggest that HMSCs associated with H II regions are warmer, more luminous, more centrally-peaked and turbulent. We also clearly show, for the first time, that the ratio of bolometric luminosity to envelope mass of HMSCs (L/M) could not be a reliable evolutionary probe for early massive star formation due to the external heating effects of the H II regions. <BR /> Conclusions: We show HMSCs associated with H II regions present statistically significant differences from HMSCs far away from H II regions, especially for dust temperature and L/M. More centrally peaked and turbulent properties of HMSCs associated with H II regions may promote the formation of high-mass stars by limiting fragmentation. High-resolution interferometric surveys toward HMSCs are crucial to reveal how H II regions impact the star formation process inside HMSCs. <P />Full Table 4 and additional data are only available at the CDS via anonymous ftp to <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr</A> (ftp://130.79.128.5) or via <A href="http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A40">http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/cat/J/A+A/637/A40</A> <P />This publication is based on the SEDIGISM and PPMAP data.},

	Abstract = {In this paper we present the CMZoom survey's catalog of compact sources (&lt;10″, ˜0.4 pc) within the central molecular zone (CMZ). CMZoom is a Submillimeter Array large program designed to provide a complete and unbiased map of all high column density gas (N(H<SUB>2</SUB>) ≥ 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP>) of the innermost 500 pc of the Galaxy in the 1.3 mm dust continuum. We generate both a robust catalog designed to reduce spurious source detections, and a second catalog with higher completeness, both generated using a pruned dendrogram. In the robust catalog, we report 285 compact sources, or 816 in the high-completeness catalog. These sources have effective radii between 0.04 and 0.4 pc, and are the potential progenitors of star clusters. The masses for both catalogs are dominated by the Sagittarius B2 cloud complex, where masses are likely unreliable due to free-free contamination, uncertain dust temperatures, and line-of-sight confusion. Given the survey selection and completeness, we predict that our robust catalog accounts for more than ˜99% of compact substructure capable of forming high-mass stars in the CMZ. This catalog provides a crucial foundation for future studies of high-mass star formation in the Galactic Center.},

@article{Battersby:2020aa,
	Abstract = {We present an overview of the CMZoom survey and its first data release. CMZoom is the first blind, high-resolution survey of the Central Molecular Zone (CMZ; the inner 500 pc of the Milky Way) at wavelengths sensitive to the pre-cursors of high-mass stars. CMZoom is a 550 hr Large Program on the Submillimeter Array that mapped at 1.3 mm all of the gas and dust in the CMZ above a molecular hydrogen column density of 10<SUP>23</SUP> cm<SUP>-2</SUP> at a resolution of ˜3″ (0.1 pc). In this paper, we focus on the 1.3 mm dust continuum and its data release, but also describe CMZoom spectral line data which will be released in a forthcoming publication. While CMZoom detected many regions with rich and complex substructure, its key result is an overall deficit in compact substructures on 0.1-2 pc scales (the compact dense gas fraction: CDGF). In comparison with clouds in the Galactic disk, the CDGF in the CMZ is substantially lower, despite having much higher average column densities. CMZ clouds with high CDGFs are well-known sites of active star formation. The inability of most gas in the CMZ to form compact substructures is likely responsible for the dearth of star formation in the CMZ, surprising considering its high density. The factors responsible for the low CDGF are not yet understood but are plausibly due to the extreme environment of the CMZ, having far-reaching ramifications for our understanding of the star formation process across the cosmos.},

@article{Bobotsis:2019aa,
	Abstract = {An investigation of dust emission associated with a large sample of H II regions has been carried out. Stacked results from this sample suggest that each H II region is at or near the center of a cluster of dense cores that extends far beyond the H II region, and has a volume density that decreases as r <SUP>-3</SUP>. The data also show evidence for enhanced numbers of cores near the boundary of the H II regions. At the same time, a significant decrease in the number of cores, consistent with no cores, is observed in the interior of these H II regions. Neither these H II regions nor their associated massive OB stars were found to have a significant heating effect on their associated dusty clumps. ``Clouds,'' or the outermost layers of the clumps in which the cores are embedded, are found to exert a strong shielding effect against external heating sources. Despite this, a large portion of the identified cores were found to be warmer than their surrounding clouds and consequently may be in the initial stages of star formation. The star-formation efficiency of the 7 H II region systems with the most reliable mass budgets ranged between 1% and 9%.},
